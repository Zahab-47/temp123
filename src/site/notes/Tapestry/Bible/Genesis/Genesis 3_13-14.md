Then the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?”

The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

 So the Lord God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this,

“Cursed are you above all livestock  
    and all wild animals!  
You will crawl on your belly  
    and you will eat dust  
    all the days of your life. . . .
