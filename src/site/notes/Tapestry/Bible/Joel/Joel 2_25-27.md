“I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm my great army that I sent among you.
 You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the Lord your God, who has worked wonders for you; never again will my people be shamed.
 Then you will know that I am in Israel, that I am the Lord your God, and that there is no other; never again will my people be shamed.
