What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said:

<font color="#ff0000">"I will live with them</font>
<font color="#ff0000"> and walk among them,</font>
<font color="#ff0000">and I will be their God,</font>
<font color="#ff0000">and they will be my people.‚Äù</font>
