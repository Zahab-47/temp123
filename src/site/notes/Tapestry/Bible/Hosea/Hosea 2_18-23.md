In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the creatures that move along the ground.
Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land, so that all may lie down in safety.
I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion.
 I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the Lord.

 “In that day I will respond,” declares the Lord—
“I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth; and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and the olive oil, and they will respond to Jezreel. I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called ‘Not my loved one.’
I will say to those called ‘Not my people,’ ‘You are my people’; and they will say, ‘You are my God.’”
