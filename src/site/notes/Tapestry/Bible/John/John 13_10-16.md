Jesus answered, <font color="red">“Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.” For He knew who was going to betray Him, and that was why He said not every one was clean.</font>

When He had finished washing their feet, He put on His clothes and returned to His place. <font color="red">“Do you understand what I have done for you?”</font> He asked them. <font color="red">“You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.”</font>
