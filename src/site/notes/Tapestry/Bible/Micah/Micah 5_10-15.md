“In that day,” declares the Lord,

“I will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots. 
 I will destroy the cities of your land and tear down all your strongholds.
 I will destroy your witchcraft and you will no longer cast spells.
 I will destroy your idols and your sacred stones from among you; you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands.
 I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles when I demolish your cities.
 I will take vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations that have not obeyed me.”
