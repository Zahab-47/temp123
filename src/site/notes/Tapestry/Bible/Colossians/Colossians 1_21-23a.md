 Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.  But now he has reconciled you by Christâ€™s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
