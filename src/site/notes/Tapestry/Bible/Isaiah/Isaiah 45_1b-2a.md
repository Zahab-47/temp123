“This is what the Lord says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of  to subdue nations before him and to strip kings of their armor, to open doors before him so that gates will not be shut: I will go before you and will level the mountains; I will break down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron.
