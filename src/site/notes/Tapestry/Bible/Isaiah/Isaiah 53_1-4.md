Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?  
 He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground.  
He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.  
Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.
 Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted.
