Praise the Lord, my soul.

Lord my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.

 The Lord wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters.
He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.
