><p class="note second">&ldquo;Nuthatches never roost alone but always in a large family known as a jar. The mother and father raise one brood each year, and offspring from previous years help raise the young. <br><br>&ldquo;Ascending a pine tree, his little round ball of a body turned upside down as he scaled the tree, the nuthatch moves in a spiral, pecking under the bark. Quick as could be, he caught a beetle and tucked it under some loose bark and pounded on the bark, splitting that beetle wide open. Thus, the nuthatch, &lsquo;hatching&rsquo; any large insect or seed.&rdquo;
