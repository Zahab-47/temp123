><p class="note second">Both the mother and father woodpecker gather food for their young. Each parent collects food from a different part of land. Both use their tongue to gather food, but in a completely different way. Once food is gathered, both parents feed the young. <br><br>If we see a woodpecker, Pappa may be highlighting a division that has occurred (often a broken covenant) that needs to be reconciled.</p>
