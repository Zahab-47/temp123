><p class="note second">Just as a place is prepared (a room added to the fatherâ€™s house) during Hebrew courtship, the male heron builds a nest in order to draw his mate. Coming upon a heron is an opportunity to let the Lord reveal what place of covenant you're adding with Him or what place of covenant a piece of land is in.</p>
