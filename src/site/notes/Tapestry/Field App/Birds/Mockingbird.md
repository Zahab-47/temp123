><p class="note second">A mockingbird's song is a repeat of something it has already heard. For this reason, it has come to represent the prophet. When this bird shows up, Pappa has something to say. Mockingbirds may relentlessly pursue a person until they ask Pappa for the message. When we see a mockingbird on land, we often ask Pappa what He wants to say or what may be hindering His voice from being heard there.</p>
