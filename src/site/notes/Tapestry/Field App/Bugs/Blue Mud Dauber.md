><p class="note second"> This wasp is a solitary pollinator known for killing pests like grasshoppers, black widow spiders, and carpenter bees. Normally one-inch long with a black body and blue iridescent wings, it is non-aggressive and settles in small swarms of several dozen at dusk before nesting in the ground at night. Its swarm habit often repels other aggressive bees or wasps from nesting near humans. </p>
