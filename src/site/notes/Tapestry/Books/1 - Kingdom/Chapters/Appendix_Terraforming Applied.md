## Appendix: Terraforming Applied

> [!quote]+
> “Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you. ” [[Philippians 3_17\|Philippians 3:17]] #bible-verse 

The pattern of Terraforming gives us an outline of how the Lord wants us to pray in the adult age of the Church. It is never meant to be a formula of what to pray every time, but only to teach us ways to express what the Holy Spirit is revealing to us as we are led to the Will of the Father. When we read the Sample Prayers out loud in our prayer times with the Lord, He feeds our spirits with the words that are being expressed. Once this is a part of us, we can pray our own prayers without using the samples.

In past chapters of application, I have emphasized the importance of Terraforming yourself before you Terraform others. The sample prayer, [[Tapestry/Books/1 - Kingdom/Terraforming for the Kingdom#Sample Prayer Self (Adulthood)\|Self (Adulthood)]] is one of the best of these to date for just this purpose. It is also important to begin Terraforming in your own sphere of influence, especially your immediate family, extended family, home, work, church, and local retail spaces. #terraforming #pray #prayer #adult-season #holy-spirit #revelation #His-will #church 

I am shouting from the mountain tops, begin Terraforming in groups! Join together, become accountable to one another. Progress to deeper places in your own heart. Ask the Lord for the authority needed to pray over wider areas. The Lord wants to expand your tent pegs! He wants you to branch out! But for this to happen safely, we are exhorted to assemble as a body. You are a hand.  God wants to attach you to a wrist, elbow, and upper

<br>

arm. He wants to attach your arm to the torso across town where the legs are headed now. As is another arm that looks just like yours does, but has an opposable function with yours.

The Lord commands a blessing when we are unified (Psalm 133). When we begin to see groups of adult sons and daughters of God gather together in holiness to pray over the land, their cities, their region, and their countries we will see the planet change. Jesus was on his own. He was the prototype. We are called to do everything that He did in unity. We then will truly become the body of Christ. Multiple children of God that fit together perfectly to make up one new man in Christ. We are literally to become Jesus on earth when this happens. The time is now. Think of it as a square dance. Step one is to find your partner... #terraforming #heart #heart-of-God #invitation #rescue #adult-season #sons-and-daughters #pray #jesus

### Sample Prayer: Person, Self

> [!quote]
> *See [[Tapestry/Books/1 - Kingdom/Chapters/Ch. 3 Definitions#People\|Chapter 3: Definitions - People]]*

##### STEP ONE: The Light of Jesus

*Father, I ask you to shine Your Light in my life. I ask you to come Lord Jesus, Lion of the Tribe of Judah and stake Your claim in my being that there would be no darkness, no hiding place for the enemy. I ask you to reveal all of the hidden things in the Light of Your Presence. Father, you know what I can handle at one time and what would be too much. I ask you to give me this day my daily bread of revelation through Your Light. I ask you, Holy Spirit to lead me to the Will of the Father that through the discernment of Your Voice, all of my prayers might be founded in Truth. I give You the glory and honor in all things.”* #prayer #light #jesus #sample-prayer

##### STEP TWO: The Blood of Jesus

*“Father, I repent of every time I have fallen short of Your Glory <note: be specific with all things revealed to you by the Holy Spirit from this point on>. I receive Your forgiveness. I ask You Lord Jesus to wash my feet with Your own Blood so that the power of all my sins is broken. I call these sins dead. I am **purified** of all unrighteousness, **redeemed** so that all things work together for good, and my access to You is fully **restored**. I ask You Lord to remember my sins no more so that I would be found holy and blameless in Your sight. And as You remember these sins no more, I ask that You would take away the pain of my sins from any person that I harmed in doing so. I cancel and strip all rights of the evil one to torment and afflict us for these sins. I hurl down the accuser by the Blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony.”* #prayer #blood #jesus #sample-prayer

##### STEP THREE: The Authority of Jesus

*“All conspiracies of evil are thwarted. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. I ask you Lord to come, All Consuming Fire, to burn any deposits left by the evil one away: any seeds, implantations, or fruit that there would be no trace of evil in my life. I call all portals, doors, or gates off-limits to the enemy camp. Father, I enforce all angelic assignments that You have given me. I receive all guardian and ministering angels that You have sent to me and the messages they carry. I choose to enter Your Presence with clean hands and a pure heart by the Blood of Jesus. I receive all miracles of provision, healing, deliverance, and freedom that You have for me today. Amen.”* #prayer #authority #jesus #sample-prayer

> *See [[Tapestry/Books/1 - Kingdom/Chapters/Ch. 3 Definitions#Places\|Chapter 3: Definitions - Places]]*

##### STEP ONE: The Light of Jesus

*Father, I ask You to shine the Light of Jesus in this place. I ask You to flood in like a river into every crack and crevice so that there would be no shadows, no hiding places for the enemy. I ask You to reveal all of the hidden things in the Light of Your Presence. Father, You know what we can handle at one time and what would be too much. I ask You to give us this day our daily bread of revelation through Your Light. I ask You, Holy Spirit to lead us to the Will of the Father so that through the discernment of Your Voice, all of our prayers might be founded in Truth. We give You the glory and honor in all things.”* #prayer #light #jesus #sample-prayer

##### STEP TWO: The Blood of Jesus

*“Father, I forgive every person that is here now, every person that has been here, and every person that will be here today. I wash them all with the Blood of Jesus that the power of all sins is undone and washed away. All curses are broken. All witchcraft is dismantled, unravelled, and undone, rendered powerless to harm us. All of creation is **purified** of the defilements, **redeemed** so that all things work together for good, and access is **restored** back to You. The memory of these sins are erased from the matter of creation. All legal rights of evil are stripped. I hurl down the accuser by the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony.”* #prayer #blood #jesus #sample-prayer

##### STEP THREE: The Authority of Jesus

*“All conspiracies of evil are thwarted. No weapon formed against us shall prosper. I ask You Lord to come, All Consuming Fire, to burn any remnant of evil away: any seeds, implantations, or fruit that there would be no trace of evil in this place. All portals, doors, and gates are off-limits to the enemy camp. Father, we enforce all angelic assignments that You have given us. We post those angels in strategic order: sentry and sentinel angels at the doors. Warring angels around the perimeter of the property, and guarding angels with each child of God. We receive all ministering angels that You have sent to us. We call this place a stronghold for the Kingdom of God. The gates of hell will not prevail here. Finally, Lord we welcome Your Presence in this place. We ask You to be the love, peace, joy, and faith within each of us here today. Amen.”* #prayer #authority #jesus #sample-prayer

##### STEP ONE: The Light of Jesus

*Father, I ask You to shine the Light of Jesus on this necklace. I ask You to reveal all of the hidden sins of those who provided the raw ingredients, those who manufactured the necklace, all middlemen, and those who sold the necklace. I ask You to shine brightly on every person who has owned this necklace before me, so that the Truth would be revealed in the Light of Your Presence. Father, I ask You to show all malicious agendas involved with the creation and ownership of this necklace. Lord, let there be nothing that escapes the Light of life. I ask You to establish Your Will in the washing of this necklace. If it symbolizes evil in any way that offends the Kingdom even after being purified, I ask You to reveal this that I might remove the necklace from my life.”* #light #jesus #sample-prayer

##### STEP TWO: The Blood of Jesus

*“Father, I forgive every person involved with the creation and ownership of this necklace before me. I wash their feet with the Blood of Jesus so that the power of all sins is broken and washed away. All curses are undone. All witchcraft is dismantled and rendered powerless to harm us. All of creation is **purified** and **redeemed**. The raw materials used in the formation of this necklace were created by You. I ask you to **restore** these to how You created them to be. Father, I ask You to remember these sins no more. I wash the necklace with the Blood of Jesus so that the memory of sin would be erased from the matter. I hurl down the accuser by the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony.”* #prayer #blood #jesus #sample-prayer

### Sample Prayers: Upper Hand

> [!quote]
> *See [[Tapestry/Books/1 - Kingdom/Chapters/Ch. 8 Upper Hand#Chapter 8: Upper Hand\|Chapter 8: Upper Hand]]*

*Father, I ask You to shine Your Light in my life. I ask You to reveal the hidden sins in the Light of Your Presence. I repent and receive the Blood of Jesus for every time I have fallen short of the Glory of God. The power of my sins is broken. I am purified of all unrighteousness and redeemed of every consequence. I ask You Lord to remember my sins no more. All rights of the evil one to manifest in my life are stripped. No weapon formed against me shall prosper.* #sample-prayer 

#### Legal Disclosure

> [!quote]
> *See [[Tapestry/Books/1 - Kingdom/Chapters/Ch. 8 Upper Hand#Legal Matters\|Ch. 8: Upper Hand - Legal Matters]]*

*I go to the supreme court, the Throne Room of God. Father I recognize that the accuser has been conspiring against me and Your Kingdom. I request a discovery phase. With the Authority You have given us, I demand of the enemy camp that all hidden plans be exposed in the Light of Your Presence. All attempts at deception, division, and destruction whether in progress or in thought only, must be completely disclosed in full detail. I command all evil to lay its plans in the Light where I will be able to see what you are trying to do, and which persons you are trying to tempt into sin before the temptation is delivered. Father, I ask You to bless our prayers of disclosure.* #sample-prayer 

#### No Discernment Zone

> [!quote]
> *See [[Tapestry/Books/1 - Kingdom/Chapters/Ch. 8 Upper Hand#No Discernment Zone\|Ch. 8: Upper Hand - No Discernment Zone]]*

*I call this place and all places that I go to a “No Discernment Zone” for the enemy camp. Evil cannot see, hear, or in any way obtain information that could be used against me or the Kingdom of God. I say that all human agents of evil lose their rights and abilities of surveillance against me and my family. All technology used to monitor our behavior will supernaturally malfunction if it is attempted to be used against us. Father, I ask You to bless our prayers of protection.* #sample-prayer

#### Incubator of Grace

*Father, I recognize that the enemy has a right to torment and afflict Jim. But Lord, You know that we are in the process of bringing him healing that will be accomplished over time, in accordance with Your Will. I ask You Father to cover my brother with an Incubator of Your Grace so Jim is protected from harm while he is in this vulnerable position. I ask You to assign angels that we might post around Jim to cover him and keep him until* #sample-prayer

*“Father, I repent of the foundational sin of being angry at God. I repent of blaming You Lord for things that were the result of demonic manifestations from human rebellion. I ask You Lord Jesus to wash my feet with Your own Blood so that the power of “anger at God” is broken. That I would be purified of the unrighteousness and redeemed of every consequence. I ask You Father to remember this sin no more. I cast down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony. I unplug the power supply of this demonic stronghold and call the nucleus neutralized. All other demons using this source for their power in my life have been cut off.

I wash their feet with the Blood of Jesus and the power of their trespasses are broken. Every curse spoken against me is broken.

All vows, oaths, and covenants of evil are dissolved. Everything that I witnessed, participated in, or consumed is void of power, broken, and washed away. All witchcraft: rituals, rites, spells, incantations, divination, hexes, potions, sorcery, candle magic, voodoo / voodoo dolls, shaman, and every human or animal sacrifice is dismantled, unraveled, undone, and rendered powerless. We are purified of this unrighteousness and redeemed of every consequence. We are restored to the men and women of God that we were created to be. I ask You Father to remember these sins no more. And just as You have remembered them no more, I ask that I would remember the pain no more. All pain in my body down to the cellular level is erased. All pain in my soul: mind, will, and emotions, is washed away.	And my wounded spirit is completely healed. I cast down the accuser* #sample-prayer

Notation: you are not judging these people - this is not an act of affecting their eternity.

They are purified of all unrighteousness, redeemed of every consequence, and restored to the men and women of God that they were created to be. We hurl down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.”* #prayer #blood #jesus #sample-prayer

##### STEP THREE: The Authority of Jesus

*“I bind and cast all demons that have just lost their rights to torment or afflict these people to the feet of Jesus, and say that they may never return. We demand a cease-fire on all deception in his life, effective immediately. All conspiracies against them are thwarted. No weapons formed against them shall prosper. We close all portals, gates, doors, or windows of evil. We ask You, Father to burn any residue from their lives, any seeds, implantations, or any fruit. We call the memory of sin erased from the matter of earth. We ask You Lord to heal them of all habits, reflexes, or instincts that have formed in their personalities around the pain of these sins. We thank You Lord that the pain is now gone.”*

*“Father, I ask You to create in me a heart for Our Family that when the prodigals come home, I will celebrate with you. When the workers that were hired at the eleventh hour are paid the same as me, I can celebrate because I am not a servant. I am Your child. Our Family has grown and will be greater because of these last-minute hires. I ask You to baptize me with Your Holy Spirit of Love so that I might go and do all that Jesus demonstrated for us to do. Amen.”*

### Sample Prayer: Soul Healing

> [!quote]
> *See: [[Tapestry/Books/1 - Kingdom/Chapters/Ch. 3 Definitions#Places\|Chapter 3: Definitions - Places]]*

#### Soul Armor

*Heavenly Father, I repent and ask You to forgive me for protecting myself with soul armor. I receive the Blood of Jesus that my own personal armor would lose its power and stand down. I receive Your armor in replacement and ask You to hide me in the shelter of Your wings. I am purified and redeemed. I hurl down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony.”*

#### Soul Valves

*“By the Blood of Jesus and the word of my testimony I declare that the accuser is hurled down in my life. I have received forgiveness and forgiven my forefathers, all those we have been in covenant with, and all those who have trespassed against us. All witchcraft is rendered powerless. All heart wounds are healed and the resulting impact of soul reliance is undone. With the authority given to me by Jesus, I call the intake valves in my soul to fully open so that all things imparted to my spirit where it sits in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus will flow freely into my soul. Equally, I declare that the out-take valves in my soul to fully open so that these things and all those that come in from my body will not be trapped like a lake but will flow out of me like a river. The world will receive the fruit of my being from this free flow from heaven through my spirit, into my soul, and out of my body.”*

#### SOUL HABITS 
(mature, adult son or daughter of God only) 

*“Heavenly Father, now that the sin in my life has been washed away and all rights of the evil one are stripped by the Blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony, I ask that You would instantaneously heal me of all soul habits so the work of God may be displayed in my life. Heal me of every way that my mind, will, and emotions have learned to walk in these sins.*

*For those habits that You would have me break through the discipline of learned behavior, I ask that You would cover me with an incubator of grace. I ask that You would shine Your Light on those men or women that You would bring into my life to stand with me as siblings or as a spiritual father. I ask You to keep me safe and loved in this process. That You would identify

ways for us to set boundaries around behavior and methods of accountability so my soul cannot hide its mistakes in dark places. When consequences are needed, I ask that You would reveal to me the loving, yet effective method that I can authorize my sibling or spiritual father to carry out. I ask You to lead us in this process fully, so that we will stay in perfect alignment with Your Will and Your everlasting covenant with David. I ask You to keep us from sin in this process. We trust You fully and ask You to walk with us through this healing.”*

I ask You for the grace to walk out the revelation You have given us to bring the Body of Christ to a place of unity where we can have strength in our numbers to win the world for the Kingdom of God. I ask You to grant to us the keys to win over massive numbers of gentiles who believe in false gods today or no god at all. And most importantly, I ask You to release to us the keys to see our Hebrew brothers and sisters enter into this new covenant with our God. That the Jewish people would be restored to us and we would finally become the one new man you spoke to Paul about by revelation. We declare by faith that Your will is done on earth as it is in Heaven, giving You all the glory. Amen.”*
