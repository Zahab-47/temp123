## Chapter 11: The Commission

> [!quote]+ 
>*“‘As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.’” [[Tapestry/Bible/John/John 20_21b\|John 20:21b]]* #bible-verse 

So, how did the Father send Jesus? For us to realize our calling as adult sons and daughters of God, we must advance our mindsets past that of the servant. Servants have no authority beyond what they’ve been told to do by their masters. When walking out these instructions, the servant is like a police officer, carrying the badge of his master’s authority. Outside of this, a servant has no authority of his own. Additionally, we must go well past the mindset of a friend. Friends have credibility when speaking on behalf of a person, but no real authority. As family, however, we embody the authority of our Father. What we say, He says. What we do, He does. #sons-and-daughters #servant-covenant #relationship #authority #jesus

Before Jesus could walk in His ministry, He had to grow up. Most theologians believe that Jesus was around 30 years old when His ministry began. Jesus was an adult. He was born from Mary’s womb and learned to walk, talk, and operate as a human being. He was taught to read, to write, and how to live as a citizen of the world He was born into. It is so important to recognize that He was not released into His ministry until He reached adulthood. Only then was He mature enough to handle the responsibilities of His Father’s authority. #friendship-covenant  #authority #maturity #adult-season 

Finally, before the spirit-filled Son of God was released in His ministry, He was tested. Our Father desires to reveal the hidden sins ([[Tapestry/Bible/Daniel/Daniel 2_22\|Dan. 2:22]] / [[Tapestry/Bible/Psalms/Psalm 90_8\|Ps. 90:8]]) that would cause us to fail in the

tasks assigned to us. No sin was found in Jesus. Once released, Jesus connected with those His Father revealed to Him as being His disciples. He then began to teach them through the demonstration of the Kingdom of God, followed by careful explanations of why He did what He did. Through this He simultaneously loved the world, while replicating Himself through instruction to His disciples. He knew that they would replace Him after He was gone. #bible-verse #preparation #jesus #transition  

When Jesus delegated authority to them, we see Him having the right to do this because He was the Son of God. The transition in mindset that we must adopt comes when we realize that WE are to have disciples ([[Tapestry/Bible/Matthew/Matthew 28_19-20\|Matt. 28:19-20]]), demonstrate and explain the Kingdom, and then delegate authority to them as well. In every way that the Father sent Jesus, Jesus has sent us. This is our commission. It is what we are called to do. #bible-verse #jesus #sin #kingdom #authority #transition #father 


### THREE TYPES OF AUTHORITY

> [!quote]+ 
>*“These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons.” [[Tapestry/Bible/Matthew/Matthew 10_5a,8a\| Matthew 10:5a,8a]]* #bible-verse 
>
>*“The seventy-two returned with joy and said, ‘Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.’” [[Tapestry/Bible/Luke/Luke 10_17\|Luke 10:17]]* #bible-verse 

There are three (3) types of authority released by the Father through the ministry of His Son, Jesus Christ. The first is the name of Jesus (Hebrew “*Yeshua*”). Commissioned with this authority before Jesus was crucified, the twelve disciples were able to bring a dramatic change in the condition of those they prayed for. People were healed, resurrected, cleansed, and delivered. Today, many Christians attribute these powers with being baptized with the Holy Spirit. In the gospels, however, it was only the commission from Jesus and His Name that empowered His followers to operate with God’s supernatural power. #yeshua #hebrew/word/yeshua #authority #father #jesus #miracles #holy-spirit 

> [!quote]+ 
>*‘Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.’” [[Tapestry/Bible/John/John 20_22b-23\|John 20:22b-23]]* #bible-verse

The second authority also comes from the commission of Jesus, but requires that we receive the Holy Spirit. After His resurrection, Jesus extended this to His followers who had been promoted to Apostles. He does this today for those who believe in Him ([[Tapestry/Bible/Ephesians/Ephesians 1_13-14\|Eph. 1:13-14]]). We have this authority as royal priests ([[Tapestry/Bible/1 Peter/1 Peter 2_9\|1 Pet. 2:9]]) who have been called to prepare the way of the Lord. The fruit of this authority is setting the captives free and hurling down the accuser through the forgiveness of sins with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. #bible-verse #holy-spirit #resurrection #royal-priest #rescue #authority #accuser #forgiveness #blood #jesus #testimony 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues [*languages*] as the Spirit enabled them.” [[Tapestry/Bible/Acts/Acts 2_3-4\|Acts 2:3-4]]* #bible-verse 


The third and final authority released by the Father through the ministry of Jesus was when He anointed them with Fire through the Holy Spirit. This was prophesied by John the Baptist ([[Tapestry/Bible/Matthew 3_11\|Matt. 3:11]]) and was a part of the instructions Jesus gave them when He told them to wait before leaving Jerusalem ([[Tapestry/Bible/Acts/Acts 1_4-5\|Acts 1:4-5]]). Those given this authority will be refined by the Fire of God ([[Tapestry/Bible/Zechariah/Zechariah 13_9\|Zech. 13:9]]). The fruit of this authority is to draw His people together in unity ([[Tapestry/Bible/John/John 17_21\|John 17:21]] / [[Tapestry/Bible/Acts/Acts 2_5-11\|Acts 2:5-11]]), to shorten timeframes required for work to be completed ([[Tapestry/Bible/Acts/Acts 8_39-40\|Acts 8:39-40]]), and to magnify the impact of Kingdom work to greater areas of influence. #bible-verse   #holy-spirit #authority #unity #connection 

This anointing is equivalent to the position held by Moses. The Lord anointed and sent him to lead the Israelites. Those in the book of Acts were anointed to birth the church of Jesus Christ and see the gospel spread across the world. It is interesting to note that when Korah and certain Reubenites rebelled against Moses’ authority, the Lord destroyed them, their families, and all of their possessions (Numbers 16). This was different than Peter and John’s refusal to obey the commands of the Sanhedrin ([[Tapestry/Bible/Acts/Acts 4_19\|Acts 4:19]]), who were leaders that God did not anoint. #bible-verse #authority #jesus #kingdom #journey #father  

### WILL OF GOD

>*“Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven. Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord,*

>*did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from Me, you evildoers!'” [[Tapestry/Bible/Matthew/Matthew 7_21-23\|Matthew 7:21-23]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus was adamant about the importance of the Will of His Father when teaching His Disciples about The Way. He would only do what He saw the Father doing ([[Tapestry/Bible/John/John 5_19\|John 5:19]]) while equally noting how the power of His Name is of no eternal value if spoken outside of His Father’s Will ([[Tapestry/Bible/Matthew/Matthew 7_21-23\|Matt. 7:21-23]]). When we are sent under Jesus’ commission, we not only produce the same output He produced, but we are fed from the same input as well. The output will be miracles, signs and wonders, healing, deliverance, resurrections, forgiveness of sins, hurling down the accuser, and setting the captives free. The input will be the Father’s Will. Before we do all of those things, we listen to the still small voice within us that leads us to His Will. We learn to get the “green light” from God before moving in His power. #bible-verse #miracles #His-will 

The Will of God is not only the “desire” of the Lord, i.e., what He wants, but what will be. Our Father created this universe knowing the outcome of every variable (including all behaviors) by every particle in it across all time through which the universe will exist. The universe literally surrounds His objective of Love. Through His sovereignty as creator, the Will of the Father is not a hope, but a reality in Heaven. Our job is to establish it on earth. #His-will #father  #healing #deliverance #resurrection #forgiveness #love #sin #accuser #heaven 

### WORD OF GOD

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For nothing is impossible with God *[and His word]*.”*[[Tapestry/Bible/Luke/Luke 1_37\|Luke 1:37]]* #bible-verse 
>
>*“So is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.” [[Tapestry/Bible/Isaiah/Isaiah 55_11\|Isaiah 55:11]]* #bible-verse 

When the Will of God is spoken (uttered) on earth, it literally becomes the Word of God (greek “*rhema*”). For us to do this, we need to be filled with the Holy Spirit, that these words are expressed to our spirits and released from our mouths. Once God speaks His Will to us and we speak it on earth, it will stand

forever. It is powerful and complete. It will accomplish what He intended for it. These words can be spoken at any point in time as a current reality even if it has not manifested in our time yet. Jesus did this several times. #greek #rhema #His-will #holy-spirit 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“...because the prince of this world now stands condemned.” [[Tapestry/Bible/John/John 16_11\|John 16:11]]* #bible-verse 
>
>*“I have overcome the world.” [[Tapestry/Bible/John/John 16_33c\|John 16:33c]]* #bible-verse 

In both of these testimonies, Jesus is quoted as speaking of things yet to come as if they have already happened. These “past-tense prophesies” are easy to miss if you are not looking for them. They can also be hard to grasp as intended, but once you do, they change your life. Jesus was able to speak of His success on the cross three chapters before it happens! This is the Word of God. Later in his letters, Paul identifies this prince as being “*now at work in those who are disobedient*” ([[Tapestry/Bible/Ephesians/Ephesians 2_2\|Eph. 2:2]]), yet Jesus describes him as being condemned years earlier. So which of them is correct? They both are. Paul was speaking within the context of the time of his writing, Jesus was speaking out the Word of God which is timeless. #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages He might show the incomparable riches of His grace, expressed in His kindness to us in Christ Jesus.” [[Tapestry/Bible/Ephesians/Ephesians 2_6-7\|Ephesians 2:6-7]]* #bible-verse 

We consist of a body, soul, and spirit. Our spirits are seated in the heavenly realms right now. In this realm, a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years is like a day ([[Tapestry/Bible/Psalms/Psalm 90_4\|Ps. 90:4]]). So for us, part of our being is confined within time (body, soul) while the rest of us is not confined within time (spirit). It is because of this that we are able to recognize what is true in the timeless realm of heaven on earth which is confined by time. Some of the things that we proclaim on earth may not be a reality at that particular point in time, but can be professed nonetheless. #bible-verse 

The kingdom of darkness will lose the war against the Kingdom of God. Jesus knew this because through the Holy Spirit, He is outside of time.  His Will is for Love to prevail, so it is true in

the timelessness of God. Therefore the defeat of satan (condemned) can be spoken of now as the Word of God even though this defeat has not happened yet in our time. Once the body of Christ realizes this truth, we will start fighting the war from the standpoint of a victory that will happen, but has not yet. We therefore must fight with all diligence, recognizing that if we don’t, the enemy will continue to win battles (cancer, suicide, murder, etc) that we should be winning. Our calling is to fulfill the past-tense prophesies spoken by Jesus as the Word of God. In summary, the world will be overcome by the Kingdom of God. #His-will #kingdom #love 

In the last couple of years, the Lord has been teaching the body of Christ about apostolic proclamations. With these we have seen prophets give words of knowledge to the apostles who then declare these on earth, seeding the atmosphere with life and sending angels on important acts of duty. This was a catch-up process given to us by the Lord to put into place the basic teaching on proclamations that was missing from the Church. It foreshadowed what was to come, which is the kingly act of hearing God’s Will in heaven and speaking It out as the Word of God on earth. Only adult sons and daughters of the King have the authority to do this. #sons-and-daughters #authority #adult-season 

Every human being alive on earth today is invited to believe in Jesus, receive the Holy Spirit which is our deposit, and to follow the leading of the Lord to the Will of the Father. When we do this the Lord will release more and more of our irrevocable gifts so we can make those unique irreplaceable contributions to the fulfillment of the Word of God in our time as it is in heaven. Not just on earth from a geographical standpoint, but from the standpoint of time (fulfilled now). As we walk in the fullness of the authority we have been delegated (Miracles from His Name, forgiveness from the Holy Spirit, and power from the anointing), we will complete the path of our destiny, our calling, and that for which Christ Jesus took hold of us. #His-will #authority #holy-spirit
