## Chapter 6: Fully Forgiving

>*“…for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony...” 
>[[Revelation 12_10b-11a\|Revelation 12:10b–11a]]* #bible-verse

>*“Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone of their sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.”*

How do you nullify an accusation in a courtroom? The answer is simple, to be found “not guilty” of the crime. How then do those who are guilty cast down the accuser? The accuser (plaintiff) stands before God (Judge) in the throne room (courtroom) and points out the sins (offenses) of mankind (defendant) day and night. His objective is to present the times that we truly fell short of the glory of God, thus giving satan power or the “right to manifest on earth.”

So if mankind is guilty of these sins, how is this accusation hurled down? The only way is through the forgiveness provided by the Blood of Jesus. It is as if our history is re-written and we never committed the crime in the first place. Complete freedom on earth is then found through the word of our testimony. This testimony includes speaking out each of the properties of being forgiven by the Blood of Jesus (Purification, Redemption, #guilt #accuser #redemption #freedom #forgiveness #testimony #purification

Restoration) as led by the Holy Spirit. This triggers the Fullness of Forgiveness, and it is found in [[Revelation 12_10-11\|Revelation 12:10-11]]. #bible-verse

>*“Let the redeemed of the LORD say this—those he redeemed from the hand of the foe...” [[Psalm 107_2\|Psalm 107:2]]*  #bible-verse 

You can’t imagine how desperately the evil one wants you to NOT know this. He will do anything to keep you from praying this way for he knows what happens to him when we do (he is hurled down). His first tactic is to keep you from the Blood of Jesus. It is critical to understand that all forgiveness must come from the power of the Blood of Jesus. This is true because nothing else can change you from “guilty” to “not guilty.” We must go to Jesus to be washed clean.

The second tactic of the evil one is to keep us from praying the word of the testimony when we give or receive forgiveness. That is, the spoken word (*logos *in Greek) that testifies (*marturia *in the Greek) to what God has done. Remember, our words have power ([[Proverbs 18_21\|Prov. 18:21]]) and it is important that we take the time to speak out what the Lord leads us to say. In a courtroom there are no assumptions or implied arguments, we must testify to what the Lord bought for us. What happens when we give / receive what the Lord bought for us with the Blood of Jesus? We are purified of all contamination. We are redeemed of all debts. The Lord remembers our sins no more ([[Jeremiah 31_34\|Jere. 31:34]]) and it is therefore as if our history has been re-written. All trace of our sin is erased. We are then restored to the men and women of God we were created to be. We are holy and blameless in His sight. This is the testimony of our forgiveness. #bible-verse  #logos  #marturia #greek

We must speak these things out to fully cast down the accuser, and he does not want you to do this. Beware of his attempts to keep you from speaking out his demise. He might offer you shortcuts in prayer to save time, tempt you with laziness, or even falsely accuse you of “praying like the heathen ([[Matthew 6_7\|Matt. 6:7]])” when you speak out what the Holy Spirit leads you to say. Be bold and courageous! When we Terraform a person (including ourselves) we must remove all rights of the accuser to torment and afflict. This is part of the “foul atmosphere” we are changing in the process. The Blood of the Lamb and the word of the testimony are keys to this. #bible-verse #holy-spirit #blood #terraforming #testimony #accuser

>*“...without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.” [[Hebrews 9_22b\|Hebrews 9:22b]]* #bible-verse 

Many Christians believe that only Jesus can forgive sins. The truth in this is that all forgiveness must come from the Blood of Jesus as its source. The two are inseparable; without the Blood, there is no true forgiveness. Ever since Jesus uttered the words, “It is finished!” ([[John 19_30\|John 19:30]]) and gave up His Spirit, the power of forgiveness has been continuously offered by the Lord through the Blood of Jesus. We only have to receive it. #bible-verse #blood-of-Jesus 

When Jesus gave it to us, the authority to forgive has come from the Holy Spirit within us ([[John 20_22-23\|John 20:22-23]]). We are authorized, commissioned, and commanded to carry forgiveness to the Body of Christ through the Blood of Jesus. Forgiveness is our priestly duty, right, and joy! As sons and daughters of the King, we are sent out to bring freedom to the world through the authority of the Holy Spirit and the power of the Blood of Jesus. We sprinkle the Blood over our brothers and sisters, breaking the power of sin, sickness, disease, pain, sorrow, and unresolved grief. We pray out the word of the testimony, speaking into their lives the truth that Christ bought them. We see them set free when the Light reveals the truth, and the Blood breaks the power of the evil one in their lives. This is love! #forgiveness #blood #holy-spirit #pray #light #truth #freedom #love

Quite frankly, this book could have been called “Forgiveness for the Kingdom” because it is the key to Terraforming. It is one of God’s “secret weapons” in his arsenal against the kingdom of darkness. It has been available to us for over 2000 years, but is just now being experienced in its fullness. As with many things in the Lord, the evil one comes to pervert the good things so as to rob us of its true power.

This is not to say that those who ask for forgiveness without speaking out the word of the testimony are not forgiven. God’s Grace is bigger than that! What it does mean is that God is teaching us how to be free so we can participate in the preparation of the Bride. With the rest of this chapter and the rest of this book, we will use this definition whenever the word “forgive” is used.

>*“Then Peter came to Him and said, ‘Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?’ Jesus said to him, ‘I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.’” [[Matthew 18_21-22\|Matthew 18:21-22]]* #bible-verse 

In every definition of “justice,” we earn punishment and consequence when we sin. It is both fair and reasonable to expect to receive “what’s coming to us” when we do what is unjust in the eyes of the Lord. We don’t deserve the forgiveness that we receive when we repent, yet we are forgiven. That forgiveness is too good to be true, but it is. It is the perfect Truth. How can we possibly withhold forgiveness from those who trespass against us?  #sin #forgiveness #truth #justice 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God…” [[Romans 3_23\|Romans 3:23]]* #bible-verse 


In light of this, we begin to understand how we want to be forgiven by God. The second greatest commandment is, *“You shall love your neighbor as yourself ([[Matthew 22_39\|Matt. 22:39]]).” *This is God’s version of empathy, which is a beautiful picture of love and selflessness. *“For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all ([[James 2_10\|James 2:10]]).” *When we realize that we are guilty of sin and that God views all sins as being the same, we cannot possibly refuse the fullness of forgiveness to another person. We deserve just punishment (death and hades) for our sins, yet God has forgiven us with the Blood of Jesus. We must do the same for our neighbors. See [[Matthew 18_21-35\|Matt. 18:21-35]]. #bible-verse 

Forgiveness is not the act of accepting an apology. There is no mention of apologies that I have found in the New Testament. You might accept their apology, but it is not a prerequisite to forgiving them. Forgiveness is not calling the trespass, “OK,” or acceptable. Forgiveness is also not joining a bowling league with the person unless they have repented. Jesus said to treat sinners who do not repent as *“a heathen and a tax collector. ([[Matthew 18_17\|Matt. 18:17]]).” *But this does not mean to withhold forgiveness. #bible-verse   #love #jesus #forgiveness #boundaries #sin #blood

>*“For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”* [[Matthew 7_2\|Matthew 7:2]]* #bible-verse 

How does God forgive our sins? He sent His only son into the world as a Lamb without blemish to be slain for our iniquities. We are now offered the free gift of receiving the Blood of Jesus to cleanse us of our sins. We should offer the same to those who trespass against us. In [[Matthew 6_12\|Matt. 6:12]], Jesus taught us to pray *“And forgive us our debts, AS WE forgive our debtors.” *In the Lord’s prayer, we ask God to forgive us in the same way we forgive others. How do you want the Lord to forgive you? The only answer can be with the unconditional sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus. #bible-verse 

We are therefore carriers of the Blood of Jesus for forgiveness in the Body of Christ. The Holy Spirit provides us with the authority to forgive and bring God’s Will on Earth. The power to forgive comes from the Blood. There is a theme throughout the New Testament of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is that we are forgiven by His Blood. This creates the clear definition that His forgiveness is the only true forgiveness, and we cannot recreate this in and of ourselves. It must come from Him. And Jesus told us that as He washed our feet, we are to go and do the same to others:

*“So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, ‘Do you know what I have done to you? You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am**. **If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet**. **For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.’”  [[John 13_12-17\|John 13:12–17]]* #bible-verse #blood #jesus #gift #pray #forgiveness #heart-of-God

Jesus forgave people who had not trespassed against Him. He did so at the leading of the Holy Spirit ([[John 6_38\|John 6:38]]). We will do the same. Some people struggle with the ramifications of this kind of forgiveness. Knowing the power of the Blood, they are deeply concerned about stripping the world of justice. It is critical that we understand whose role this is. We are not Judges of our brothers and sisters. That belongs to God alone. Our job is to forgive them with the same standard of measure that we want to be forgiven. Then let God take care of vengeance, justice, and judgment. #bible-verse #holy-spirit #judgment #justice #forgiveness 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.” [[Luke 6_37\|Luke 6:37]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus was very clear that there is a difference between judgement, condemnation, and forgiveness. His teaching was always based upon Love, which includes forgiveness. As a Hebrew, Jesus knew that blood is for the atonement ([[Leviticus 17_11\|Lev. 17:11]]) and that the two are inseparable ([[Hebrews 9_22\|Heb. 9:22]]). When Jesus used the word “forgive” He knew full well that one day the church would hurl down the accuser through forgiveness with His own Blood. #bible-verse 

### BREAKING THE POWER OF SIN

#bible-verse 

The Blood of Jesus strips sin of all power. It is this power that causes us to stumble. The temptation is not just a choice, it is a

 powerful entity within us. The evil one uses this against us to bring temptation for sins that we have a history of committing, either from our own choices or those of our forefathers. This is the reason that many sins feel like addictions. It is nearly impossible to be set free. Praise be to Christ Jesus who bought our freedom!

To break the power of sin, simply apply forgiveness (offered or received) and cast down the accuser with the Blood of Jesus and the word of the testimony. Put the sin to death by killing the power and stripping the rights of the enemy to torment or afflict. The Truth has set us free, and we are free indeed! #choice #blood #addiction #truth #freedom #accuser 

It is important to note that forgiving others as a royal priest is a significant responsibility that should not be taken lightly. Remember that the person you are forgiving must repent and sin no more to keep power and authority from returning to the evil one. Our job is bring the forgiveness of Jesus at the leading of the Holy Spirit. The Lord will know when it is the right thing to do.

### SECOND KEY

“Power and authority are given to satan and his kingdom every time we freely choose to sin. Royal Priests strip the evil one of these rights by fully forgiving the people who sinned, sprinkling them with the Blood of the Lamb. We then hurl down the accuser with the word of our testimony, stating that the Blood of Jesus purifies, redeems and restores us to God.” #royal-priest #forgiveness #accuser #blood #jesus #rescue #redemption #kingdom #accuser #prayer
