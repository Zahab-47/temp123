Terraforming is a function of the royal priesthood to prepare creation (person, place, or thing) for the Presence and Glory of the Lord through the power of the Blood of Jesus and the authority of the Holy Spirit. Terraforming is also the act of changing the atmosphere in our homes, our work, our schools, and in the lives of our family, our friends, and even our enemies by defeating evil and establishing strongholds for the Kingdom of God. #relationship 

The word Terraforming started as science fiction, but is currently viewed by scientists as being a lofty dream of how to colonize other planets in the future. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) defines Terraforming as “*transforming a hostile environment into one able to sustain human life*.” It is literally meant to take an alien world (Mars) and make it more like the world of origin (Earth). This book does not discuss the morality of space exploration, but rather uses the term as a picture of God’s strategy for His sons and daughters on earth. #royal-priest #terraforming #blood

Terraformers change conditions (atmospheres) to reform earth. Using “Terraforming” as a name for our Kingdom work is divinely inspired, but can also be seen as a play-on of words. Earth became hostile to the Kingdom of God at the fall of man in Genesis 3. And although the second Adam, our Lord Jesus Christ brought victory over death and hades , the Earth remains hostile to this day. We have been commissioned to bring the Will of the Lord to this world, making disciples of all men. As this happens, Earth becomes hospitable to the Kingdom of God, or Terraformed. #His-will  #kingdom  #terraforming 

### His Presence

> [!quote]+ 
>*“There, above the cover between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the Testimony, I will meet with you and give you all my commands for the Israelites.” [[Exodus 25_22 \| Exodus 25:22]]* #bible-verse 

God is everywhere ([[Psalm 139_7-8 \| Ps. 139:7-8]]). He has no beginning and no end. He is all-powerful ([[Luke 1_37\| Luke 1:37]]) and all knowing ([[Hebrews 4_13\|Heb. 4:13]]). That being said, God also chooses to dwell with His people in an intimate way. He gives us more of Him so we can detect His Presence, and receive from Him in a direct way. We receive revelation, healing, comfort, joy, and euphoria in this place of love and affection. We also give to Him as we minister to His Heart through our thanksgiving, praise, and worship. The Presence of the Lord is priceless and above all value. When David felt distant from It, he cried out for It (Psalm 13).  #heart-of-God #kingdom #royal-priest  #revelation 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“You have made them to be a kingdom *[royal power to rule over a kingdom] *and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.” [[Revelation 5_10\|Revelation 5:10]]* #bible-verse

God is holy. There is no chance of Him doing evil. Before welcoming the Lord to dwell among us in this intimate setting, we must prepare for Him as priests. This role includes washing the area of all evil so our Lord is not welcomed into an unholy environment. Terraforming is changing the environment of a person, place, or thing from unclean to clean, from evil to good. We destroy demonic strongholds and establish a stronghold for the Kingdom of God.

### Terraforming Outline

Any person, place, or thing is Terraformed when we pray over them. The first part of this prayer is asking the Father to shine the **Light of Jesus **that reveals all impurities, contaminants, or pollutants. Most impurities are sin or the effects of sin, usually in the form of legal rights for the “devil and his angels” ([[Matthew 25_41\| Matt. 25:41]]) to torment, afflict, or interfere with the work of the Kingdom of God on Earth. The second step is when these are washed clean by the **Blood of Jesus **and the word of the testimony. This is a prayer of forgiveness for the person or the people whose sins resulted in the contamination of the place or thing. It includes speaking out the effects of the Blood on that person to testify against the accuser. The third step is when any effects or remnants of evil are removed with the **Authority that Jesus gave to us **through the Holy Spirit. We are careful to stand in agreement with all blessings that the Father has spoken into them since before they were born. #terraforming #light #jesus #prayer #bible-verse #blood #holy-spirit #forgiveness 


##### People

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Who may ascend into the hill of the LORD? Or who may stand in His holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart…” [[Psalm 24_3-4a\| Psalm 24:3-4a]]* #bible-verse

God was clear in His instructions to the Israelites that they were to be clean before entering His presence or witnessing His move. The people of God were commanded to wash their clothes before the cloud came to them to demonstrate the Fire / power of God just prior to the giving of the Ten Commandments ([[Exodus 19_10 \|Ex. 19:10]]). #bible-verse 

Before allowing His priests to enter the Tent of Meeting, God instructed Aaron and his sons to be washed and become physically clean ([[Exodus 29_4\| Ex. 29:4]]) and then to have the blood of sacrificed animals sprinkled on them to become spiritually clean ([[Exodus 29_21\| Ex. 29:21]]). #bible-verse

This was reiterated over and again as critical, with death as the consequence of disobedience. Before the Israelites crossed the Jordan River into the promise land, Joshua had them consecrate themselves. It is God’s will for His people to be clean before entering His Presence. It was never an issue of whether they were His people or not. They were. The issue was purity.

One example of Terraforming a person is when you are about to pray for them face-to-face. It is important to understand that praying for someone should be a time for that person to experience the Presence of God. Simultaneously, as the one praying, you can be listening to the Holy Spirit for guidance on how the Father wants you to pray. As such, you will want to be able to hear the Lord speak and not the enemy. You also want the person you are praying for to hear the truth in your message, and not the distorted version. Satan wants to interfere with all Kingdom work happening on earth. His objective is to steal, kill, and destroy ([[John 10_10 \| John 10:10]]). Terraforming is the process of removing him from the equation. #bible-verse #prayer #holy-spirit #terraforming 

Many times we pray for people that are not in the room with us while we are praying, but will be at the time of the event you are preparing for. These can include family members, friends, enemies ([[Matthew 5_44\| Matt. 5:44]]), and complete strangers. We always ask the Lord to soften their hearts and open their minds to the Will of the Father. This is accomplished when we take the time to prepare ourselves and the person as the Lord has instructed us, with His Light, His Blood, and His Authority. #prayer #light #blood #heart #bible-verse #kingdom #terraforming 

### Places

> [!quote]+ 
>*“And so they will cleanse the land.” [[Ezekiel 39_16\| Ezekiel 39:16]]* #bible-verse 

God has also referred to the cleansing of the land. This can be seen when God speaks through the prophet Ezekiel about the future downfall of Gog, probably the king of Magog – a land north of the Black Sea and east of the Aral Sea. After God draws the armies of Magog to the mountains of Israel, He slaughters them there. God tells His people to bury the dead to cleanse the land. It is critical to recognize the significance of what God is saying here.

The exposed corpses of God’s fallen enemies will rot with bacteria, and also with demons that have legal rights to fester. This could result in a plague that would infect the Israelites and interfere with God’s work in their lives. Because of this, the land is unclean. #legal-right 

The Lord repeats this when He tells the Israelites to hunt for any trace of exposed bones. These are to be buried to cleanse the land. The legal right of the demons to fester in the exposed bones of God’s enemies could bring long-term calamity that would harm God’s people. To protect them and His work in their lives, God commands them to bury the bones. By completing the death of God’s enemies through proper burial, God’s people were protected. This is a picture for us today of how thorough this cleaning needs to be – and that can be accomplished only with the Blood of Jesus.

“Places” are where Kingdom work is accomplished; therefore we must bring God’s Will in advance of, and in support of our work. These “places” can include large areas such as the city we live in. It also includes the land under our house, our church, our ministry, our workplace, and the grocery stores, gas stations, and shopping malls we visit. In short, you can Terraform any place on the planet! #His-will #terraforming 

If there are two examples that people find to be the most useful, it would be Terraforming your house and your church / ministry. Your house is where you rest, recuperate, and where many people raise their children. Portals exist in almost every American home that can allow the evil one access including the TV, the phone, and the computer. Attacks are easy to identify: when that sense of agitation, unrest, or any temptation of sin invades our home. It is similar at church where new Christians are being taught as disciples, and mature Christians are being prepared to launch into their field of harvest. If you see signs of the accuser at work: lies, division, or destruction, it is time to Terraform. #discernment #light-of-jesus #terraforming 

Many intercessors are familiar with the concept of a “walk through.” This is where we prepare a building before an event (temporary residence), before moving in (new permanent residence), or even to go back and clean something up (existing

permanent residence). This is both an offensive and a defensive strategy for preparing a place for the Kingdom work that will happen there.

Another excellent example is a hotel room. We advise that you do not sleep in a hotel room until you have thoroughly Terraformed every corner, but especially the bed. When I traveled for business before knowing this, I had all kinds of trouble. The most common attacks are sickness and temptations of sexual sin and chemical abuse. Almost every hotel room in America has in-room television with pay-per-view movies, which include “adult” titles and horror films filled with violence. The acceptance of these things gives rights to the enemy in the room that must be dealt with before Kingdom citizens sleep there! #intercession #intercessor #terraforming #kingdom 


### Things

> [!quote]+ 
>*"See!" he said to all the people. "This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the LORD has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God." [[Joshua 24_27\| Joshua 24:27]]* #bible-verse 

The stone *heard *all the words that the Lord said??? How is this possible? Joshua demonstrates in this verse that matter has God- given memory and testifies to the words of the Lord. So too, our words, actions, and choices remain as a testimony that will either be for us or against us ([[Matthew 12_36-37\| Matt. 12:36-37]]). If a person commits a sin in a room, the materials in that room will remember the sin. These include the wood in the floor or furniture, the paint on the walls, and the metals in the fixtures. When entering this room for Kingdom work, these memories must be washed, or erased, through forgiveness with the Blood of Jesus. #bible-verse #forgiveness #terraforming 

Other examples include cars, roads, houses, lamps, sofas, and jewelry such as rings, watches, necklaces, and even false teeth. The list of “things” can be so extensive, that you can easily give in to fear and get bogged down trying to pray over every little detail. The best approach is to once again, listen to the Holy Spirit to lead you to what item is producing the right of the enemy to torment and afflict, and focusing on those things to Terraform.

The objective of Terraforming is to remove all interference by the enemy and to establish the Will of God. It is the complete package of preparation: identifying hidden obstacles with the Light, detaching them with the Blood, and dislodging them with the Authority of Jesus. Once this process is complete, the atmosphere of the person, place, or thing will change immediately. There has been a shift from the darkness to the Light, and it is powerful. #bible-verse  #terraforming #holy-spirit #blood #His-will #light #testimony #forgiveness 

Terraforming always ends in welcoming the Presence of the Lord and worshipping Him. This can be music, singing, dancing, motion, or words of adoration. Although Terraforming itself is a prayer, it is always the preparation, or introduction to another prayer. And as our Lord Jesus taught us, prayer always begins with worship. *“Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name….” [[Matthew 6_9\| Matt. 6:9]]* #bible-verse 

The Lord is holy. He wants us to be clean before entering His presence. He does not want impurities in our hearts, or in the things that surround us, or even in the land we stand upon. His instructions were given when the Israelites built the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting. These instructions were made perfect in the new covenant ([[Jeremiah 31_31 \| Jer. 31:31]], [[Luke 22_20\| Luke 22:20]]), that through the Blood of Jesus we have the power to erase the unholy past of our lives so we can stand free in the present. With these contaminants removed, we will see victory in our lives for the Kingdom purposes to which we have been called ([[Philippians 3_12\| Phil. 3:12]]). #bible-verse #terraforming #authority #prayer #worship #kingdom #purpose
