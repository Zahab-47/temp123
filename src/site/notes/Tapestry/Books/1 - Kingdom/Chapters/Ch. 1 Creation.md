## Chapter 1: Creation 

An author of books was the sole survivor of a shipwreck. He drifted for days on wooden planks before reaching dry land. The island that he found was perfect for sustaining life, it had freshwater, fruit trees, and the raw materials for shelter. But soon he found himself bored to tears. As an author, he realized that he could write his next book right there on the island and it would be ready to go for publishing as soon as he was rescued. Although drenched, his backpack had survived the wreck. The pencils worked fine, but his pads of paper took days to dry out before he could get started. #authority

His next step was to choose a plot. But for some reason he found himself with writer’s block. Try as he could, there was simply nothing that held his attention to write about. He thought of several adventure stories, but all seemed bland. He had some ideas about betrayal and intrigue, but they were of no interest to him. After days and days of thinking, contemplating, and adjusting, he was about to give up on writing altogether.

One day he realized that he was extremely lonely. After several months alone, he was starving for any kind of human contact. Yet day after day, there were no signs of rescuers to be seen. Eventually, his need for love became unbearable and he decided that action was required. With the objective of curing loneliness, the author realized that a book about robots would be fun, but would not provide the love that he desperately needed. He was not yet a father, so he decided that his story would be a fictional

<br>

account of his children that he believed would be born once he was rescued and got married.

Not having kids before, he wasn’t sure where to begin. He always wanted both a boy and a girl, so he decided to write his book about an older teenaged son named Eric and a younger teenaged daughter named Tiana. He had a fairly good idea what he wanted them to look like (their dad) so he moved on to their interests, hobbies, talents, and aspirations in life. When he finished he realized that this story had great potential of being a blockbuster. The author was very encouraged. He felt like this crazy idea just might work in both ways, passing time productively while he waited to be rescued, and curing his loneliness.

That night he fell into a deep sleep. To his surprise and utter joy, Eric and Tiana were in his dream. They interacted with him as children do, with fierce love for their daddy. He talked to them and shared his heart with them. He told them things he had never told any other person. They both learned much from him. Eric wanted to be a writer one day too. Tiana just wanted to curl up in daddy’s arms and tell him all about her pony.

When the author woke up he cried with joy. Eric and Tiana were like real children of his that he loved deeply, admired, and quite frankly was proud of. He wrote down everything that happened in the dream, developing the characters into complex, true-to-life people with great potential ahead of them. This continued for weeks. He would go to sleep at night, dream of his kids, and then wake up the next day and write the story based upon the events in the dream, or events he made up based upon their personalities. All day long while cooking or fixing problems with his shelter, he would anticipate that night’s dream with his babies.

He decided to create other people to build the story. He gave them each a friend and a guard that watched over them day and night. He put them in a town where they could interact with many different people in countless scenarios that would demonstrate the strength of their character. They were very popular around town. Everyone knew their names and appreciated what loving children they were.  Whenever the

<br>

author introduced someone new in his book, they would appear in his dreams that night behaving just as he wrote them out to be.

The author began to notice something amazing. At night the stories would take on a life of their own. Although he would write down basic characteristics about each person, they would do things in his dreams that were not written by him but were extensions of those characteristics. He created them as if they were real humans like himself, and this is how they behaved in his dream. They were aware of themselves, thought, spoke, and freely chose to do what suited them best. It was as if the characters were writing the story with him. Every day he would say to himself, *“if only every book I wrote was this easy!”*

Then one night the author fell asleep. As his dream began, there was great commotion going on in town. He ran through the streets to find out what was the matter. He heard a familiar voice cry out, *“Dad!” *Just then Eric ran up and cried out, *“We can’t find Tiana anywhere!” *The author panicked. He thought of his beautiful daughter and how much he loved her. It was too much to bear! Finally, a witness was found who said that he saw Tiana’s guard kidnapping her. He had taken her by force with his hand over her mouth, onto her horse, and ridden away to the north.

The author woke up in a cold sweat. He was very angry. It was beyond his reckoning that the guard that he had created, with valor, courage, and might had betrayed him in such a way. The very purpose for his creation was to protect her. He had violated his own meaning by becoming the threat to her safety. While writing his book that day, the author wrote in a rescue party led by Eric. He included every supply that he would need to get his sister back. Nothing was left to chance. He couldn’t wait to get back to his created world and find his dearest daughter.

That night the author dreamed that he organized the rescue party with Eric at the helm. They were staffed with 1,000 soldiers, every food supply, weapon, and resource needed to survive months of searching if needed. But finding her wasn’t the problem. The army came back after only a few weeks. Eric rode up to his dad with the report of what they found.

*“Tiana’s guard took her to the mountains in the north. The trail was hot and we found them quickly. But in the days while they traveled, her guard gave her an extract from a plant growing in the fields. It intoxicated her to keep her from struggling. She has become addicted to the substance and it has changed her personality drastically. She refused to come back with us and is threatening to kill herself if we come back.”*

The author woke up. He cried for hours and screamed out, *“NO! Tiana don’t do it! Come back to me!” *His dearest daughter that he loved so much was lost to him and it was more than he could bear. His emotions ranged from heartbreak, to downtrodden angst, to downright anger. He was mad at her for what she was doing. But nothing could stop him from remembering the girl that she truly was. The one that was a woman of might, the one he created her to be. He forgave her and knew that the only chance was for him to go and get her himself.

That night the author dreamed that he mounted a horse and rode north with Eric at his side. They found the traitor guard and Tiana almost immediately. The author dismounted and motioned to Eric to stay behind him. The guard, feeling confident with only two foes to defeat, rose to his feet with his sword drawn. But the author wasn’t there for combat. He knew that to free his daughter, he had to remove the source of her bondage. She did not know how to make the addictive extract. The guard did.

The author lunged towards the guard with a hidden dagger exposed as it was plunging into his heart. Unabated, the guard extended his own sword that the author had to go through to get to his foe. Both were dealt fatal blows. They fell to the ground to take their last breaths. Tiana, seeing her daddy dying, snapped out of her trance and jumped to his side. With Eric next to her, the author said, *“Son, care for your sister. I have forgiven her. You do the same.” *Tiana, cried out with grief. *“Daddy I am so sorry!” *The author replied, *“I love you, I did this because I love you. Never forget. Your daddy loves you.” *He died in their arms.

The author woke up. Two men were shaking him to see if he was alive. It was a ship! They had found him and were able to take him home.  He thanked them whole heartily, rode the ship

home, and went on to publish his book. He never dreamed of Eric and Tiana again. But the book was a big hit. It became a bestseller on both sides of the ocean. He titled it, “Creation.” The author got married and had two kids. A boy named Eric and a girl named Tiana. They both bore a striking resemblance to their daddy.

### Love Defined

It can be difficult to grasp that God, and therefore we, will never end. Our minds struggle with it because it is an enormous picture to create. Yet our lives have continuously moved in a forward direction, so “never-ending” is something we can make work. Each of us have experienced growing up, graduations, projects completed, promotions, etc, but these are simply changes in life. If you are reading this, you have never experienced “ceasing to exist” (different from “death”), so with a little effort we can take a hold of “never-ending.” #never-ending #never-beginning #creation #eternal #eternity

The tough one is “never beginning.” No matter how you twist and turn, that one is hard to settle in with. We all have a “beginning” that lies within God’s act of creation. We have no memories before this event. This is where our attempts at emphasizing with God end. God has always been. The concept of God having no beginning while creation has a specific beginning is mind boggling. God created the heavens and the earth, but what happened before that? Let’s face it, God has had a LONG TIME to do many things before we were created. #never-ending #never-beginning #creation #eternal #eternity 

Imagine that you are God and it is now before creation was created. Who is God and why would you create in the first place? “God is love,” but what does that mean? We know that God defined “love” in this world as selfless affection, and “affection “ is defined as a fond or tender feeling towards somebody or something. A friend of mine used to say, “Love is having both empathy and common goals.”  In both examples,

<br>

<p style="text-align:center;">

<br>

love is a **relationship** between two or more things, and so we have a problem. You are God, and God is love, but there is only you. You are alone. Remember, this is before creation. So, whom or what do you love? #love #relationship 

We see that a requirement for “love” to exist is that there are at least two objects, the **lover** and the **loved**. You can love yourself, but is that “love” in its complete form? It seems that the fullness of the definition of “love” demands that it is manifested three (3) ways: 1.) loving yourself, 2.) loving those that love you back, and 3.) loving those that hate you (enemies). This manifestation of love meets the requirement of at least two objects, and also provides a test in the loving of one’s enemies, as this love must be pure and unconditional. #love #blueprint 

The mind of God is to fully define love by creating those that love Him back ([[Matthew 22_37\|Matt. 22:37]]), and those that do not love Him back. It is also to *become the relationship *of love between the two or more beings that He created ( [[Matthew 22_39\|Matt. 22:39]], [[Matthew 18_20 \| Matt. 18:20]]). This is the reason for creation. Love is made complete in the creation, and God is love, so God has chosen to complete Himself through creation. We see this in marriage especially where “two are made one.” What a glorious role and purpose that we have!!! God has created us to complete himself. Some will love him back, others will not. Tested love is made perfect, and this is the purpose of creation, to have perfect love. #love #heart-of-God #blueprint #relationship #bible-verse #purpose #destiny 

<br>

### Offspring Defined

To complete “love,” God knew that His creation must be far more than the mechanical construction of machines and robots. First, His creation needed to be organic. That is, complex, precious, unique, and irreplaceable. This is the opposite of a machine, which can be replicated by design. We are not ever the same over time. We grow in body, soul, and spirit from the day we are born to the day we die. God chose to make each human being one of a kind. There will never be another ‘you.’ You are very special. This is an important attribute in creating something capable of perfecting love. #freedom #choice #love 

Second, God’s creation needed to have “choice,” or the freedom to choose.  God had no interest in creating robots that were

<br>

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p>

---

<br>

“preprogrammed” to love Him. He wanted His creation to choose to love Him. Freedom is another requirement for love to exist. Fond and tender feelings for another do not come from captivity, but in the freedom to choose from multiple options – and then choosing the one that is the best. #choice #love #freedom #relationship #heart-of-God 

> [!quote]+
> *"I said, 'You are "gods"; you are all sons of the Most High.'” [[Psalm 82_6 \|Psalm 82:6]]* #bible-verse
 
Essentially, God’s creation needed to be like Him, so He created the concept of “offspring,” or having children. In His brilliance, God knew that the best model for love would be to create “gods” that could complete this picture of “love” that He was painting. To fill this need, He made children - creation that was created “in His image” with similar attributes as Himself. These include freedom, choice, judgment, the ability to create, emotions, etc. #children #create 

God is BIG. God is God. So for God to create the “loved” there is a size gap that is tough to overlook. “Little me” is tiny next to God, and His awesomeness alone could cause us to be incapable of loving Him without the influence of fear, thus nullifying choice. To compensate for this, God hid Himself. It is possible to grow up on this planet and never know that God exists because He is not seen with our eyes or heard with our ears (in the natural world). This creates the concept of Faith, whereby the “loved” of God must believe in Him without seeing Him. #choice #love #faith #god #freewill #freedom #risk 

The second way God handled the size issue was to create many small children that are designed to fit together through love into a larger entity. This beautiful tapestry allowed our mighty and awesome God to pour His love out on more than just one child, while still accomplishing the goal of at least two objects: the lover and the loved. Not one child is more precious than the other – we fit together into one body. In this He created the concept of marriage, which was fulfilled through Christ and His church. #bride #one-flesh #marriage #love 

A final point to make is that there are problems that arise from choosing to create children. Six or seven billion people made in God’s image, with freedom of choice, is a dangerous thing. There are many implications that had to be dealt with. It takes a mighty God to keep the planet from imploding. All of this points

<br>

to the requirement of our fallibility and our need for a savior. It pains me to hear people say that they cannot believe in a God that would “allow children to suffer.” If only they understood that it pains God too. He does not want them to suffer, but allows humans to have their free choices so Love can be fully defined. #love #freewill #choice #heart-of-God 

<br>

#### Heaven and Hell

To have love, there must be choice. But what are we choosing between? The simple answer is love and “not love,” which has been referred to by many as “good and evil.” God created good and evil, but did not force it upon us. We were allowed to choose even this very path and whether we would go down it or not. Adam and Eve made that choice on our behalf, but it was one that we all would have made as well. #choice #good-and-evil #not-love 

God called it the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil.” By eating the fruit of this tree, the human creation was choosing to see this picture completed. We are fulfilling the definition of “love” as we now know that there is good that we can choose and there is evil that we can choose. Because of this, there will be those that love Him back, and those that do not. Once we started down that path, we had to see it to completion. It was a one-way street. #good-and-evil #creation #love #choice 

For good and evil to exist without chaos, there had to be consequence, implication, and result. These are mandatory to the completion of love. From this came the concepts of benefit and detriment. As God has defined it, love is good. As such, “benefit” was assigned to choices of good and “detriment” was assigned to choices of evil. God is directing His creation towards Love. That is where His plan is heading.

Just as we are capable with effort to comprehend the concept of “never ending,” so too are we able to grasp “Heaven.” The idea of incomprehensible peace, joy, happiness, and above all love is like thinking of winning the lottery. We dream of Heaven with

ear-to-ear grins. The more we get to know our God, the more we want to spend all of our time with Him. Heaven is the culmination of creation: God the Lover and us the Loved. #heaven #love #heart-of-God #creation #never-ending

Along the lines of “never beginning,” the horrors of hell are beyond any nightmare we’ve ever encountered. The idea of being alone, in pain, suffering with unquenchable thirst is enough to make anyone tremble. Hell is real. It is the ultimate detriment that results from choosing “not love.” We are free to make whatever choice we want to, and we receive the consequence of those choices just the same. #not-love #never-beginning #choice 

<br>

#### Fallibility

God created human beings in His image, but we are not exact replications of Him. We were made to depend upon Him for everything and to love Him back. The choice of Adam and Eve resulted in the door opening for those that will not love Him. But we are not quick to judge. We have all sinned ([[Romans 3_23\| Rom. 3:23]]) and the Lord said that “*the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur*” ([[Revelation 21_8\|Rev. 21:8]]). Knowing this, we realize just how desperately we need Jesus. #bible-verse #not-love #defilement #sin #choice #witchcraft 

We are created singular, that is one person. In this state, we find ourselves weak when it comes to our identity. We are created in His image, but we have found that behaving that way is a different story. When Adam and Eve bit into that apple, the evil one obtained the ultimate legal right, one that we were incapable of stripping him of. We received the knowledge of good and evil, thus empowering our ability to choose many times over what it was. But this also put us in the position of realizing our weakness: we were not capable of choosing good as God does. #evil-one #legal-right #choice

#### Savior

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.” [[John 3_16 \| John 3:16]]* #bible-verse 

All of this presented our need for a savior. God knew that we needed a change in nature to be able to meet the qualifications of love. Therefore, He elevated us up to His level by sending His only Son into the world to live as one of us and die innocent. His blood brought about the ultimate change in condition: Redemption. We have become worthy of being called the Lover and Loved of God through the fullness of Christ within us who is our righteousness and makes us Holy and Blameless in the eyes of our Father. #blood-of-Jesus #forgiveness #redemption #restoration 

> [!quote]+
>*“And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.” [[Romans 8_9b-10 \| Romans 8:9b-10]]* #bible-verse #change #spirit-of-God #redemption 

The author of life loved us so much that He died so we could be free and have real life. We were created in His image so we could be called His sons and daughters and not His slaves. But that meant our having the freedom to choose Love or not-love. This is required for Love to be fulfilled, but hard for the Author of Life because He must watch as we make choices that harm ourselves and his other children. Jesus died for us so we could become the worthy Lover and Loved of God. Now with His Light, Blood, and Authority, we are able to live as His children, bringing the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Will of the Father to earth as it is in Heaven. There is much to do. While we’ve been distracted with other things, the evil one has infested the earth with darkness. #jesus #heaven #love #not-love #sons-and-daughters #relationship #inheritance #distraction #evil-one
