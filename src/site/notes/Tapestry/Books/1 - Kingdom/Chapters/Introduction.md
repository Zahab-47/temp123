No, we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.” [[1 Corinthians 2_6-7\|1 Corinthians 2:6-7]]* #bible-verse

This is a very exciting time that we live in. All of creation has been groaning for this time since the beginning. Our forefathers dreamed of doing what we will do. This is the generation that seeks the face of God and will stand in the Holy Place of His Presence. In this generation, we do not love our lives even unto death.

But risk taking is the building block of Faith. From here, the Lord provided opportunities for fruit to be produced. And there has been much of that, from people being saved, healed, and delivered, to supernatural miracles in the land.

The Lord provided scripture last to confirm the revelation He had given. Why? He did not want us to search the scriptures trying to get life instead of coming to Him to have life. And so the Royal Priests have been commissioned to prepare all of creation for His Presence.

Here is the exciting part. If the Lord sends us to prepare for Him, doesn’t that mean that He is coming? It does. He is coming with Fire and He will anoint us to do the things that our forefathers only dreamed of.
