## Chapter 15: The Last Battle

>  *“So God created man in his own image.” [[Genesis 1_27a\|Genesis 1:27a]]* #tester #bible-verse 


The Lord is taking us on an adventurous journey into the fullness of our calling and destiny as sons and daughters of God, unified into an adult church. We are learning that there is nothing that Jesus did that we are not called to do. In fact, He said that we would do greater works than what He did on earth! As we continue this process of identifying all things that Jesus did and seeing them in the Light of being what WE will now do, we are encouraged to push on to the fullness of Christ. We are desirous of everything that God has for us because we know that our identity in Him and our calling is far beyond our furthest expectations. It is bigger than we thought. #journey #fullness #calling #destiny #sons-and-daughters #unity #jesus #light

Even though Abraham had a covenant with the Lord for descendants that were as numerous as the stars, he was told to sacrifice Isaac on the altar. Isaac was the embodiment of that covenant with God, yet it was this very thing that Abraham was called to sacrifice. In the last days, we are invited to place everything that we are on this altar. The Lord is saying, “those that give Me everything will have nothing to contaminate the power that I give them.” They can be trusted with the fullness of

Christ, which is the greatest power and authority in all of creation. #heart-of-God #His-will #abandoning #trust #kingdom #invitation

People after the heart of God give all to Him, so He uses us for His great will to be done. That means giving Him our ambitions, needs, even our very lives. Are you willing to lay everything you want at the feet of God? Are you willing to lay your basic needs at the feet of God? Are you willing to let your heart be broken for the Kingdom? Are you willing to be falsely accused for His testimony? Will you trust God with the lives of your children? Your spouse? Yourself? #heart-of-God #His-will #abandoning #trust #kingdom #invitation  #adult-season

##### STEPHEN

*“Now Stephen, a man full of God's grace and power, did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people. Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)—Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia. These men began to argue with Stephen, but they could not stand up against his wisdom or the Spirit by whom he spoke.” [[Acts 6_8-10\|Acts 6:8-10]]* 

Does our commission from Jesus, which includes every way that the Father sent Him, include being crucified? Let’s look at the first martyr of the newly birthed church to see our answer. Stephen was not just a follower of the Lord, he operated in the same manner of authority that Jesus did. He then was not just stoned, but killed in a state of innocence, just as Jesus was. Stephen’s ministry and death mirror that of Jesus with significant precision. Like Jesus before him, Stephen was a son of man, filled with the Holy Spirit. What came of this? #wisdom #freedom #spirit #holy-spirit

As the Father sent Jesus to walk a righteous life, teach, preach good news, perform miracles, and to not love His life even unto death, so Jesus sent Stephen to do the same. Stephen was an example to every generation thereafter and to every age of the church of what [[John 20_21\|John 20:21]] could look like. This is not to say that we all have the destiny of martyrdom: the apostle John was not martyred. Stephen’s life serves as an example that we all should take note of.

What is the effect of martyrdom? When Jesus died, the earth received the free gift of eternal salvation. When Jesus was wounded, the earth received the gift of freedom, deliverance, and healing. So what did the earth receive when Stephen died? Losing Stephen was a blow to the early church. Certainly, the Lord did not want Stephen to be stoned to death. So what benefit could possibly come from the death of this man of God? #miracles #gift #salvation

>*“As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?’ ‘Who are you, Lord?’ Saul asked. ‘I am Jesus, whom you are*

>*persecuting,’ he replied. ‘Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.’” [[Acts 9_3-6\|Acts 9:3-6]]* #bible-verse

The Lord appeared to Saul without an invitation. He imposed Himself onto Saul whereby there was no question in his mind that God was real, and His son was indeed Jesus. All things held equal, this is a major violation of The Rules. By presenting Himself in this way, the Lord took away Saul’s freewill and made a choice for him. He was blinded until he followed the Lord’s instructions to the letter. If the Lord did this for everyone, we would not be free to choose Love over not-Love. The very definition of Love is at stake. So why did the Lord do such a thing? #freewill #love #not-love #invitation

When a son of man, filled with the Holy Spirit, and rendered spotless by the Blood of Jesus is martyred (stolen from the Kingdom of God on earth), the Lord receives the legal right to replace that person with redemption and sevenfold restitution ([[Proverbs 6_31\|Prov 6:31]]). This is not the right for the birth of a human in the natural, but a right to bring someone into the Kingdom of God. That means divine intervention into the life of someone, in this case, someone with a very high call. #bible-verse  #god #freedom #freewill #love #not-love #holy-spirit #blood-of-Jesus  #legal-right 

### PAUL

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of Me and what I will show you. I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.'” [[Acts 26_16-18\|Acts 26:16-18]]* #bible-verse 

When Saul became Paul, he became the redemption of the life of Stephen. Although Stephen had great gifting and anointing on earth, the Lord replaced the loss of him with one that was given far greater responsibilities than Stephen had. Paul was commissioned to set the captives free from the deception of the evil one, and to release them into their “place” or destiny in the Kingdom of God. In the end, he wrote most of what we refer to as the “New Testament” through his letters to the churches. Paul’s writings are considered to be a road map for every person

seeking to grow in maturity through Christ Jesus. He has affected billions of people. #redemption #freedom #destiny 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of His grace by enabling them to do miraculous signs and wonders.” [[Acts 14_3\|Acts 14:3]]* #bible-verse 

Paul’s ministry started very similar to Stephen’s. He traveled extensively and preached the good news of Jesus Christ. He taught on the ways of God and how to live and conduct themselves. He showed great wisdom in his dealings with every person, especially the Pharisees and the Sadducees. He demonstrated the Kingdom of God through miraculous signs and wonders, leading many to Jesus. He was hated by the teachers of the law. #redemption #destiny #kingdom #jesus 

Soon Paul’s ministry transitioned to the founding of churches throughout Asia Minor and Greece. As this chapter unfolded, Paul began to take on the role of father to these church bodies. He was viewed with great authority as the person who lead many of the original church members to Christ. Paul was also the one who followed up with wisdom and instruction on how to live life as an individual and corporately in this new revelation of the Truth of God. For the Jews, this meant the fulfillment of many covenants and the introduction of a new covenant. For the Gentiles, this meant grafting-in to a Hebrew way of life of which they had little understanding. #steward #destiny #truth 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you. But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have. For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power. What do you prefer? **Shall I come to you with a whip**, or in love and with a gentle spirit?”* *[[1 Corinthians 4_18-21\|1 Corinthians 4:18-21]]* #bible-verse 

Once Paul had brought the message of salvation to people and the freedom that came from the power of the name and Blood of Jesus, he next focused on the process of fathering the church into righteousness. This meant outlining the life of loving God first, and then our brothers. He had to confront the mistakes and blatant choices of members in the body to pollute The Way or

promote their own self agendas. Although less desirable, it was Paul’s calling to be the father figure in their lives. It was his job to be the final word that enforced the boundaries of conduct that kept them on the right path towards wholeness in Christ. #authority #wisdom #truth #salvation  #steward 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“This will be my third visit to you. I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: **On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others**, since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.” [[2 Corinthians 13_1a-3\| 2 Corinthians 13:1a-3]]* #bible-verse 

Just as we are free to create accountability partnerships with those in the brethren that will help us to walk a straight line, our spiritual fathers have a role to play as well. The Lord is preparing many to become fathers to the church now that it has reached adulthood. Those people will give birth to new revelations, new breakthroughs, and new levels of authority for the Body of Christ to walk in. Each person who desires to achieve completeness, wholeness, or fullness in Christ will submit to these fathers for accountability and discipline. #accountability #steward #relationship #trust #change #heart-of-God 

The people of God must move past the relationship of servant and friend and into the covenant of family (inheritance). Here the believer will complete the work of sanctification through complete submission to God. The Holy Spirit reveals to us those root sins that give evil its rights to tempt, torment, and afflict us. Forgiveness through the Blood of Jesus and the word of our testimony will set us free. Those called to be fathers will undergo deep levels of cleansing so they will be worthy of the responsibility of guarding the gates to the city of God (His sheep). They will then represent the father on earth to love the flock to purity through honest confrontation of those habits that remain. Our submission to these fathers is critical for the Body to attain perfection. In this place we will be trustworthy to walk in the fullness of our calling. #inheritance-covenant #holy-spirit #root #sin #forgiveness  #authority #wholeness #fullness #relationship #purification #blood-of-Jesus #heart-of-God
