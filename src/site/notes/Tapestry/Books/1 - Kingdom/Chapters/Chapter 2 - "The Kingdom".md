## Chapter 2: The Kingdom

> [!quote]+
> *“I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.” 
> [[Tapestry/Bible/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 6_18\| 2 Corinthians 6:18]]* #bible-verse 

A King of great wisdom, wealth, and power defeated all of His enemies. He conquered their lands once and for all. Yet the lands continue to be filled with evil marauders that perform guerrilla warfare to undermine the King’s authority and ultimately try to overthrow His government. Worse still, the marauders have kidnapped the King’s daughter. He loves all of His children greatly, but this was His youngest child. She was born small, the runt of the litter. She is helpless, afraid, and lost. Her Father knows this and He is desperate to get her back. He wants to see the culture of His Kingdom brought to all of the lands and the evil marauders captured and neutralized. But this is not a mission that He can assign to His paid servants. Those who are motivated by self can be easily derailed from the goal. This is a job that can only be handed to family, specifically His other sons and daughters.

Before the Father will send each child, they will have to grow up some. The babies cannot go. Only the children that are tall enough to ride a horse, and strong enough to wield the tools, and wise enough to handle the money can go on this expedition. The Father will choose those children with the maturity and character needed to endure the trials and challenges they will see on this journey. The King will be careful in sending any of His children that are wounded. Only those who walk in their healing are

strong enough for the trials to come. He will not put any of them in a position where they would fail in the mission or hurt themselves in the process. He loves His children very much. #allegory #relationship #maturity 

The Father has storehouses of provision, everything they will need for this mission. He has money, horses, food, tools, servants, an army, and even friends in high places that can offer assistance. But He knows His children well. To one, He cannot give $1 million dollars to because the son will end up losing it at the horse races. But His other daughter is very good with money – she has proven herself time and time again. To her the Father will entrust with the bank account. His other son is a master horse rider. The Father will give this son charge of the horses to transport the search party to find and return their sister home.

The Father wants the chosen, grown-up children to have His Heart, a heart of selfless love for His Family and the Kingdom. In the parable of the prodigal son, the brother was angry with his father for how he received his brother back. He said, *“Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends*.” His father responded, *“‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found’” ([[Tapestry/Bible/Luke/Luke 15_29,31-32\| Luke 15:29,31–32]])*. What the father is saying is, “son, if you had my heart, you would help me throw the party!!!!” If the brother had maturity and strength of character, his heart would be like his father’s. His response would be rejoicing and celebration! #bible-verse #storehouse #inheritance #maturity #heart-of-God #love

### Listeners Who Learn

>*“But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.” [[John 16_13 \| John 16:13]]* #bible-verse 

The Father is very wise. He needs His children to trust His Wisdom and to listen to Him speak. He knows us better than we will ever know ourselves. He wants us to trust Him to teach us how to become the men and women we were created to be. He also knows where His lost daughter is and how to get her.  He

needs us to listen to His instructions and to receive His gifts so we will be successful in getting her back. He is aware that there are many distractions that would keep us from using the gifts He gives us unwisely or to delay our getting her home. #voice #trust 

The Father has sent us out with His Helper, the Holy Spirit, who leads us to His Will. God is speaking to us all the time, but many of us are missing these priceless messages. Everything in this book is meant from the perspective of being prayed, so our ability to hear God speak to us is invaluable. We are not praying formulas, but rather as led by the Holy Spirit, supported by an ever-deepening understanding of the Way of God.

The key to successful listening is being baptized in the Holy Spirit ([[Tapestry/Bible/Acts/Acts 1_5\| Acts 1:5]], [[Tapestry/Bible/Romans/Romans 8_10\| Rom. 8:10]]) and having an ever-shrinking list of things that distract us from hearing. As the world’s demand for convenience grows, the list of distractions in our lives is rising like a rocket. As with all things, we must deal with modern conveniences using great wisdom. Two key examples are the television set and the internet-ready computer. The goal of the enemy is to rob us of time with our God, and that makes us ineffective children. We start to win the war when more of our time is spent soaking in the Presence of our Father.

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Him who is the Head, that is, Christ.” [[Ephesians 4_14-15 \| Ephesians 4:14-15]]* #bible-verse #holy-spirit #His-will #wisdom #maturity 

Mature children know to only listen to their Father’s report. When the Israelites were about to enter the land Canaan that was promised by God, Moses sent spies to ascertain the lay of the land. They brought back good news; the land was full of milk and honey. They also brought back an evil report; the land was full of giants that needed to be conquered before they could take it. To the demise of that generation, they listened to the evil report and faltered. They should have listened to neither. The only thing that mattered was that God promised the land.

### Responsible

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.” [[Proverbs 18_21 \|Proverbs 18:21]]* #bible-verse 

The Father is sending us off as His Representatives. We carry His authority with us as His Children. Mature sons and daughters of the King know that their words have great power. It is imperative that we speak out the Truth that God speaks to our hearts and nothing else. We have been given great authority through the Holy Spirit and great power through the Blood of Jesus. The Lord is teaching us daily to make us mature in Him so we can be good stewards of this. It should never be taken lightly. #truth #holy-spirit #heaven #steward #legacy #trust #authority 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” [[Tapestry/Bible/Matthew/Matthew 16_19\| Matthew 16:19]]* #bible-verse 

Sons and daughters with strength of character do not allow evil words to leave their mouths. There is a concept in American vernacular today known as “venting,” which is short for ventilation or, the release of something that has been contained under pressure (my definition). More specifically, “spewing words of frustration about how the actions of a person affected MY agenda.” This is fruit of demonic lies that try to get us to judge the actions of another person. Over time, it builds up within us with great pressure. The enemy wants to get us to speak this out in a public setting to destroy our credibility or to cause an offense in another person. “Venting” has no purpose in the Kingdom of God (See  [[Matthew 12_33-37 \|Matt. 12:33-37]]). It is a good example of how we have been misled into using the power God gave us for ill. #bible-verse #selfishness #self-sourcing #self-protection 

##### Kingdom Focused

Our Father is not just a wealthy and powerful man, He is the King. That makes us princes and princesses. His Kingdom exists now, it does not begin when we die or a thousand years from now. It began at Calvary. God placed all things under the feet of Christ and appointed Him the Head over all things for the church when He raised Christ from the dead ([[Tapestry/Bible/Ephesians/Ephesians 1_20-22\| Eph. 1:20-22]]). We are citizens of this Kingdom ([[Tapestry/Bible/Ephesians/Ephesians 2_19\|Eph. 2:19]]) in heaven ([[Philippians 3_20 \| Phil. 3:20]]), sitting together in Christ, now ([[Tapestry/Bible/Ephesians/Ephesians 2_6\|Eph. 2:6]]). As sons and daughters of the King ([[Tapestry/Bible/Galatians/Galatians 4_7\|Gal. 4:7]]), we are privy to the Master’s business ([[Tapestry/Bible/John/John 15_15\| John 15:15]]) and have purpose in it: to go and feed His sheep in all nations ([[Matthew 28_18-20 \| Matt. 28:18-20]].) This is His priority ([[John 21_15-17 \|John 21:15-17]]), especially for the least of His brothers ([[Matthew 25_40 \| Matt. 25:40]]). #bible-verse #birthright #inheritance 


The Father wants to teach us to become men and women of character. The fruit of this is love. By spending intimate time with Him, we learn to hear His voice and grow closer to Him. It is here in this place that God reveals the mysteries of His Heart to us. True joy is being in the Presence of the Lord. *“You have made known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.”* [[Tapestry/Bible/Psalms/Psalm 16_11\|Ps. 16:11]]  #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>“But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.” [[Tapestry/Bible/1 Peter/1 Peter 2_9\|1 Peter 2:9]] #bible-verse 

A **royal priest ** is a son of man (human), filled with the Holy Spirit, and commissioned by the King of Kings, Jesus Christ. The Lamb that was slain redeemed us to God and made us to have the authority to rule a kingdom and to be priests that reign on the earth ( [[Tapestry/Bible/Revelation/Revelation 5_9-10\|Rev. 5:9-10]]). As priests, we prepare the environment in advance of God’s coming, usher in His Presence, and minister to His Heart through praise and worship. As kings, we move with the authority of the High King to defeat the enemies of God and establish His Will on the earth. This combination of privileges defines our Kingdom identity and destiny. #bible-verse #love #heart-of-God #intimacy #royal-priest #His-will #destiny

### Mission

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.” [[John 14_12 \|John 14:12]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus emulated for us everything we will do on this mission. He brought Light and Truth everywhere He went. He healed the sick, raised the dead, performed miracles and supernatural signs and wonders. He Loved. His Blood empowers us and His Holy Spirit authorizes us to do the same and more.

This Father knows what the marauders are doing to His daughter. He knows that she is kept in a cage in the dark where she has been beaten, cursed at, raped, sold into prostitution, and made to do, consume, and witness unthinkable things. He realizes that the mission to get her back is urgent. It cannot wait another day. He needs His other children to find her, bring Light to her, and get her home where she can be healed and renewed. #rescue #destiny #restoration #light-of-jesus 

Terraforming is a strategy for the sons and daughters to transform the environment around them to the culture of their Father’s Kingdom, and to get their sister back. It comes from the storehouses of the Father: it is His wisdom for bringing Light to the dark places. Even those children who have been delayed by the tactics of the marauders or their emissaries will be able to get themselves back on track. It is His wisdom for moving with the authority we have inherited to wield His Power and conquer the marauders. It is the wisdom to bring our sister home to Daddy.

God wants us to trust Him and give Him everything. Then He can teach us to hear His voice and stay in the Truth ([[Tapestry/Bible/Matthew/Matthew 13_23\| Matt 13:23]]), to stand on the foundation of Christ so trials and persecution will not knock us down ([[Matthew 13_20 \| Matt 13:20]]), and to learn love so we understand that God’s priorities are paramount and distractions of the world are worthless ([[Tapestry/Bible/Matthew/Matthew 13_21\|Matt. 13:21]]). #bible-verse #trust #distraction 

Our hearts have changed. His priorities are now ours. It is with great honor that we bring our Father’s Kingdom to this land. But it is with passionate urgency that we rescue our sister. There is only a limited time allocated in all of eternity for this mission. We don’t plan to come home until we have her… #bible-verse #light #truth #storehouse #inheritance #trust #rescue #blood #terraforming
