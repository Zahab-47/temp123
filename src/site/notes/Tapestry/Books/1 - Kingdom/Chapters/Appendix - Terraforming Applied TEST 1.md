## Appendix: Terraforming Applied

The pattern of Terraforming gives us an outline of how the Lord wants us to pray in the adult age of the Church. It is never meant to be a formula of what to pray every time, but only to teach us ways to express what the Holy Spirit is revealing to us as we are led to the Will of the Father. When we read the Sample Prayers out loud in our prayer times with the Lord, He feeds our spirits with the words that are being expressed. Once this is a part of us, we can pray our own prayers without using the samples.

In past chapters of application, I have emphasized the importance of Terraforming yourself before you Terraform others. The sample prayer, [[Tapestry/Books/1 - Kingdom/Terraforming for the Kingdom#Sample Prayer Self (Adulthood)\|Self (Adulthood)]] is one of the best of these to date for just this purpose. It is also important to begin Terraforming in your own sphere of influence, especially your immediate family, extended family, home, work, church, and local retail spaces. #terraforming #pray #prayer #adult-season #holy-spirit #revelation #His-will #church 

I am shouting from the mountain tops, begin Terraforming in groups! Join together, become accountable to one another. Progress to deeper places in your own heart. Ask the Lord for the authority needed to pray over wider areas. The Lord wants to expand your tent pegs! He wants you to branch out! But for this to happen safely, we are exhorted to assemble as a body. You are a hand.  God wants to attach you to a wrist, elbow, and upper

arm. He wants to attach your arm to the torso across town where the legs are headed now. As is another arm that looks just like yours does, but has an opposable function with yours.

The Lord commands a blessing when we are unified (Psalm 133). When we begin to see groups of adult sons and daughters of God gather together in holiness to pray over the land, their cities, their region, and their countries we will see the planet change. Jesus was on his own. He was the prototype. We are called to do everything that He did in unity. We then will truly become the body of Christ. Multiple children of God that fit together perfectly to make up one new man in Christ. We are literally to become Jesus on earth when this happens. The time is now. Think of it as a square dance. Step one is to find your partner... #terraforming #heart #heart-of-God #invitation #rescue #adult-season #sons-and-daughters #pray #jesus

### Sample Prayer: [[Tapestry/Books/1 - Kingdom/Terraforming for the Kingdom#People\|Person, Self]]

##### STEP ONE: The Light of Jesus

*Father, I ask you to shine Your Light in my life. I ask you to come Lord Jesus, Lion of the Tribe of Judah and stake Your claim in my being that there would be no darkness, no hiding place for the enemy. I ask you to reveal all of the hidden things in the Light of Your Presence. Father, you know what I can handle at one time and what would be too much. I ask you to give me this day my daily bread of revelation through Your Light. I ask you, Holy Spirit to lead me to the Will of the Father that through the discernment of Your Voice, all of my prayers might be founded in Truth. I give You the glory and honor in all things.”* #prayer #light #jesus #sample-prayer

##### STEP TWO: The Blood of Jesus

*“Father, I repent of every time I have fallen short of Your Glory <note: be specific with all things revealed to you by the Holy Spirit from this point on>. I receive Your forgiveness. I ask You Lord Jesus to wash my feet with Your own Blood so that the power of all my sins is broken. I call these sins dead. I am **purified** of all unrighteousness, **redeemed** so that all things work together for good, and my access to You is fully **restored**. I ask You Lord to remember my sins no more so that I would be found holy and blameless in Your sight. And as You remember these sins no more, I ask that You would take away the pain of my sins from any person that I harmed in doing so. I cancel and strip all rights of the evil one to torment and afflict us for these sins. I hurl down the accuser by the Blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony.”* #prayer #blood #jesus #sample-prayer

##### STEP THREE: The Authority of Jesus

*“All conspiracies of evil are thwarted. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. I ask you Lord to come, All Consuming Fire, to burn any deposits left by the evil one away: any seeds, implantations, or fruit that there would be no trace of evil in my life. I call all portals, doors, or gates off-limits to the enemy camp. Father, I enforce all angelic assignments that You have given me. I receive all guardian and ministering angels that You have sent to me and the messages they carry. I choose to enter Your Presence with clean hands and a pure heart by the Blood of Jesus. I receive all miracles of provision, healing, deliverance, and freedom that You have for me today. Amen.”* #prayer #authority #jesus #sample-prayer
