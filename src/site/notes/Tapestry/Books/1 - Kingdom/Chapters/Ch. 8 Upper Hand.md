## Chapter 8: Upper Hand

> [!quote]+ 
>*“You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn..”* [[2 Samuel 22_37\|2 Samuel 22:37]]  #bible-verse 

American football is a great sport. People in the U.S. spend a significant amount of time investing in it. I myself, for example, have repented of an overindulgence in this game that resulted in fits of rage unbecoming of a pit bull with its nose hairs on fire. Much less a man of God. But there are several excellent analogies that you can glean from the sport, one of which I will notate here both to illustrate my point and to bring redemption to my previous personal admonishment.

Football has the greatest examples of “comebacks” in all of sports, as far as I am concerned. As a former (rehabilitated) maniacal fan, I could tell many a’ story of games that were lost until the last second, when, HEY! We won!!! There is excitement and fun (for most) when watching your team pull it together (finally), march down field (why couldn’t they have done that two quarters ago?), and score the points needed to win the game. But the lesson is not in what they did at the end. It is in what they could have done at the start of the game to avoid the need to catch up in the first place.

We are not on equal footing with the enemy of our God. We have advantage because Jesus Christ, the innocent Lamb, died for our sins and redeemed us. We have been called sons and daughters of the King and are now a royal priesthood, carrying

His Blood to bring forgiveness to the world, break the power of sin, and set the captives free. We have been given authority to change the atmosphere on earth from darkness to the Kingdom of God. We can do this now, in advance of trouble, not when we are buried head deep in it. #jesus #blood #atmosphere #authority #kingdom #darkness 

We have the upper hand in this war. When we realize this and begin walking in this authority, asking the Lord to reveal the hidden sins in the Light of His Presence and forgiving with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony, we gain more and more of the Authority that Jesus set aside for us as an inheritance. It isn’t fair that we can ask God for His Grace to cover us while we operate in new revelation. This might mean that the rights of the evil one get stepped on in the process. That is just the way it has to be. When we obey the Lord and bring His Will on earth as it is in Heaven, we have upper hand in all things. #light-of-jesus #hidden #forgiveness #authority #His-will 

Our God has the ultimate upper hand as the Creator of the universe, all-powerful, all-knowing, all-present. He is outside of time. Equally, His children have been given the same footing. When we realize just how deceived we’ve been, it can be mind boggling. The enemy uses every advantage it has against us. They operate in the spiritual world where most people cannot see. They lie. They distort God’s creation to make sin look and feel good to empower the temptation. The Truth is that we have authority to overcome all of their power. When this becomes real in our lives, the war becomes easy. #power #truth #authority #revelation #temptation 

With the Light of Jesus we see all plans of the enemy. We are able to overcome the darkness that evil hides in and know what to deal with in the right timing, and in the right sequence. We can see clearly to clean the bathtub. With the Blood of Jesus, we soak the grime on the bathtub and simultaneously kill all germs. The crusty junk detaches itself from the surface. Then with the Authority of Jesus, we easily wipe the bathtub clean. From start to finish, the advantage is ours!

### LEGAL MATTERS

An example of upper hand is when we spend time in the court room. No, I am not referring to the place you go after disrupting the peace at a Broncos game. The Throne Room of the Lord is like a court room in many ways. The plaintiff (accuser) brings charges daily against us (defendant). We must choose our attorney. Either we represent ourselves or we let Jesus defend us. Without Jesus we are found guilty and can succumb to condemnation and shame and get locked up in the dark. Or better, we plead the Blood of Jesus and are found Not Guilty. #jesus #guilt #blood-of-Jesus #forgiveness #cover 

But as with all court cases, there can be a “discovery phase” to the accusation. After all, before you can respond to an accusation, you have to know what exactly it is you are being accused of. So we demand full disclosure of the plaintiff. That is, the plaintiff must disclose all evidence that he is using against you in the accusation. All of this is taking place after the sin has been committed, so why, you ask would I care about having that information disclosed by the enemy? I don’t. It is right to demand the information that I am highlighting. #accuser #accusation 

There is no time in heaven. And we know that most all sin can include the temptation / urging of a demon. We therefore demand that the enemy disclose to us his plans, his strategies, his conspiracies, and in all ways that he is working towards bringing us down BEFORE we sin. Upper hand means that we have the advantage through the authority given to us from Jesus to require our enemy to tell us what he is planning so we can shut down the plans before they are given a chance to succeed. #sin #demon #temptation #authority #jesus 


### NO DISCERNMENT ZONE

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Hide me in the shadow of your wings.” [[Psalm 17_8b\|Psalm 17:8b]]* #bible-verse 

It always bothered me that demons have the ability to listen in on our conversations with our brothers and sisters, not to mention our prayers to the Lord. These are private and meant to be family business, not public. Because of this we now set up “No Discernment Zones” for the enemy camp. Through the authority given to us by the Lord, we exercise the principle of upper hand by commanding all demons to stop stealing information from us.

Demons only have the right to eavesdrop when we sin. When we are communicating in love and prayer, they have no right to listen in. We therefore command them to strip themselves of all “sensory” faculties (for lack of a better term) that they would normally use to gain intelligence. This is a war and we know that information is key. Cutting off this supply line is paramount to our strategy, both offensively and defensively. We therefore say that no agent of evil can see, hear, or in any way obtain information that can be used against us or the Kingdom of God. #prayer #relationship #secret-place #demons #sin #listen #kingdom #god #no-discernment-zone 

### INCUBATOR OF GRACE

> [!quote]+ 
>*“If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.” [[Luke 9_23b\|Luke 9:23b]]* #bible-verse 

Terraforming is not a formula. It is a lifestyle, a process of turning to God and receiving each day our daily bread of revelation, freedom, and healing. Although it is true to say that there are points of completion, especially with Terraforming places or things, most of the time the prayers are ongoing. A person will often times receive revelation of evil manifesting due to past sins for days, weeks, months, or even years after first asking the Lord to shine His Light on their lives. #terraforming #god #revelation #light #prayers #daily-bread 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.” [[Acts 15_11\|Acts 15:11]]* #bible-verse 

Yielding to our Father’s allotment of daily bread will often times result in periods of time between prayer when the job is only half done. This is a necessary part of the process and can result in a person being exposed to enemy exploitation. To combat this, we ask our Father for the blessing of His Grace to cover and protect them while we continue the process. We call this the “Incubator of Grace.” An incubator is a contained environment used to protect endangered babies while they grow and heal. Equally, we ask the Lord to provide this same kind of shelter. #wait #grace #rest 

The enemy can’t stand this kind of encroachment on their legal rights to torment and afflict. Under normal conditions, they would be able to punish the person through the sins that remain for the healing they received. We not only request this protection for the person, but we also command that the enemy cannot

bring retaliation or revenge. Unfortunately, we learned this lesson the hard way with many people leaving the prayer time with the target on their chest. But since we began praying this way, the opposite has been true with people getting to rest and seeing miraculous changes in their lives. The Lord has blessed us with such advantage because He loves His children so much! #daily-bread #father #prayer #grace #legal-right #rest #love 

### THIRD KEY

“Jesus has commissioned His royal priests to walk with the highest authority on earth, giving each son or daughter of God the full advantage in the war through their choice of Love.”

Creation was made by God to work in the favor of Love. Because of this, His children have the most potent weapon on earth: forgiveness with the Blood of Jesus. The advantage for not-Love is operating in the dark. When we walk as God designed us to in the Light the power of evil dissolves. This is not a level playing field.  #love #creation #light #forgiveness #blood #jesus
