## Chapter 10: Adulthood

> [!quote]+ 
>*“She gave birth to a son, a male child *[adult son]*, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.”* *“...they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.” [[Revelation 12_5a,11b\|Revelation 12:5a,11b]]* #bible-verse  

Some people may ask, “why are we able to hurl down the accuser now and not for the last 2,000 years?” The answer is that something amazing has happened in the church. All creation has been groaning for this day when the sons (adult sons) of God are revealed ([[Romans 8_19\|Rom. 8:19]]). The Spirit of the Lord is testifying that in this day God has given five talents ([[Matthew 25_14-30\|Matt. 25:14-30]]) to His sons all across the world and they have said “yes” to their calling. They have accepted the invitation. They are fulfilling all that God expects of them. They have laid all that they have on the altar. They have sold all of their possessions to follow Jesus ([[Matthew 19_21\|Matt. 19:21]]). They do not love their lives so much as to shrink from death. #bible-verse #sons-and-daughters #maturity #relationship #invitation 

The Church has grown into a corporate adulthood. Although, as individuals, we may be at different “spiritual ages” (newborns in Christ, toddlers, adolescents, adults), the Church itself has attained a corporate maturity ([[Ephesians 4_13\|Eph. 4:13]]) that has been long misunderstood. The sign of the maturing is the release of authority that God has given us because we are adults, and therefore are trustworthy to handle it.  The trigger was when

those sons and daughters were revealed through their answer of “yes” to the call, and through their heart of giving all to God. #adult-season #maturity  #bible-verse  #sons-and-daughters  #authority #god #heart #spirit-of-God  #invitation    #relationship 

The fruit of this Church age will be seeing the saints attain fullness in Christ. But before this can happen, we have some catching up to do. The adolescent sons and daughters of God must embrace the discipline of our Father. This process of maturing where the sanctification by the Spirit of God is made manifest can be painful. Because of this, many men and women of God shirk from the rod of the Lord. It is impossible to avoid His discipline, but the key is for us to embrace it. That is, to receive the Lord’s discipline as a freewill choice of our soul. By doing so, we obtain all that He intends for us without rebellion which hardens our hearts. #soul #maturing #seasons #spirit-of-God #choice #father #sons-and-daughters 

### TWO HOUSES

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever.” [[2 Samuel 7_16\|2 Samuel 7:16]]* #bible-verse

The Lord really likes David. He is a man after His own heart. While it is true that David made mistakes, he never betrayed the Lord. He had an intimate relationship with God that grew deeper and deeper as his life went on. David displayed the love and mercy of God everywhere he went. He was a fierce warrior, but tender as a lamb. Because of his heart, the Lord made David’s house permanent. Jesus was a direct descendent of David; the Kingdom of God comes from his loins.#heart-of-God #relationship #jesus #David #love #heart #intimacy 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“You acted foolishly," Samuel said. "You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD's command.”* [[1 Samuel 13_13-14\|1 Samuel 13:13-14]]*  #bible-verse 

Saul did not have an intimate relationship with the Lord. Samuel did. As such, when Saul needed to know whether Israel should turn left or right, he had to ask Samuel. The house of Saul was plagued with failure. It was never God’s intent for His government to be lead through the will of man. The Lord wants

us to be intimate with Him so we can operate out of His Will. Once Saul was anointed, he continuously disobeyed the Lord, was jealous, angry, fearful, and had a heart for murder. When pinned, he resorted to witchcraft to get what he wanted. He was God’s anointed, but he relied on his own strength instead of seeking the Will of the Father. #surrogate #relationship #intimacy #His-will #strength #anger #fear #choice 

God is calling His people to make a choice. Will we align ourselves with the house of Saul or the house of David? The answer is so obvious to the modern Christian that it makes the question seem rhetorical. Of course we all choose the house of David! Everything that we believe in rests in the Lord Jesus Christ who Himself is of the house of David. Would we choose different from our Lord? But if we are ready for the fruit of this choice (kingdom endures forever), are we ready for the cost (crucifixion)? #choice #david #kingdom #jesus

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it.’” [[Matthew 16_24-25\|Matthew 16:24-25]]*  #bible-verse

In the original covenants (old testament), tithing was a first fruit offering to God of 10%. In the fulfilling covenant (new testament), Jesus wants everything. That is, 100% of us belongs to God. By giving Him everything that we are in full submission, we are preparing ourselves for our wedding. This intimate relationship of dependency for protection, sustenance, health, and understanding is critical to our developing into the fullness of our calling. Knowing that all Hebrew covenants among family cannot be ended, it is important to add that the Lord still honors His call for a tithe, which is why many people can attest to its benefits. But the fullness of God is realized when we give Him everything we have.  #choice #kingdom #covenant #relationship #intimacy #wedding #bride #bride-covenant #trust 

### DAVID’S COVENANT

When we choose the house of David, we must embrace the unending covenants that the Lord made with him. The section of David’s covenant ([[2 Samuel 7_12-16\|2 Sam. 7:12-16]]) that most prefer to overlook is the one where the Lord says that He will discipline us with the same wooden instrument used by parents on their children. That He will bring humans into our lives to administer His discipline. This goes against everything that our current Western culture accepts. #bible-verse #David #covenant 

The idea of God disciplining His children that are adults in body so that they can become adults in spirit is “outside of the box” if you’ve made the mistake of trying to put God in a box. Some are too prideful to submit to such instruction. Others have been wounded by the spirit of religion whereby humans of the house of Saul controlled them through manipulation and fear, and then called it discipline. This is not what is described in scripture.

The Lord has outlined a process by which all persons in the house of David will fully submit themselves to God’s discipline no matter what it looks like. They trust that through their intimate relationship with the Lord, He will bless and protect them. This is a requirement for entering into the fullness of our calling. It is the bridge scripture between the birth of David’s offspring (verse 12) and their responsibilities as kings (verse 16). That is, before we can get to adulthood, we must embrace the discipline of the Lord (verse 14). #covenant  #spirit #religion #trust #intimacy #relationship #sons-and-daughters #love  

### ADULTHOOD DESCRIBED

When I was a kid, I despised school. I did not want to get up early, I wanted to sleep in. I did not want to take the time to shower and get dressed, I wanted to lounge in my pajamas. I did not want to study and learn, I wanted to play and have fun. I did not want to learn social skills by interacting with people I did not like. My grades were poor, I had a “C” average by the time I graduated High School. Then as an adult, I went back to school and earned a masters degree from a very good school. My grades were excellent; I had an “A” average even though I was going to school full-time while working full-time. What made the difference? As an adult, I loved learning, I embraced learning, and so therefore, I learned.  I understood that the

benefit of having learned was far greater than the cost of learning.

When I was a kid, time moved so slowly. A school year felt like a school DECADE. Growing up from the age of 6 to the age of 16 (driver’s license) seemed to take forever. Learning to play guitar chords starting at age 10 was a long and painful process. Then as an adult, the years seem to fly by! What made the difference? There is an acceleration that occurs when we are adults due to the maturity of our minds. I can learn to do new things very quickly. Time is the same, but I have changed dramatically. #change #transition #adult-season

>*“Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.” [[Hebrews 5_13-14\|Hebrews 5:13-14]]* #bible-verse

When I was a kid, I strongly disliked mushrooms. I wasn’t all that excited about vegetables either. Broccoli and spinach were never on the menu and you did not even think about feeding me lima beans. I would not have eaten sushi if you had paid me a thousand dollars. Then as an adult, everything changed. Sushi is my favorite food, I love vegetables, and only eat mushroom pizza. What made the difference? As an adult my taste buds have changed. My pallet desires more than just sweet and salty. I want flavors and the more the merrier.  #seasons #change #adult-season #maturity #transition 

### ADULTHOOD OF THE CHURCH

When I started High School, it was rough being a Freshman. I was new to the freedoms that come with the promotion from Junior High to High School, and the greater expectations that were placed on my shoulders. As a freshman, I had little to no authority in the hallways walking between classes. Upperclassmen clarified their superiority with verbal and non- verbal communication, and often with intangible and __tangible__ demonstrations. Then one day, I was a senior! I was top dog. No one bossed me around and all fear was gone. I was content and happy. I then graduated from High School and went to college. Suddenly I found myself a freshman again...

The entire body of Christ has just been promoted from seniors in the adolescent age of the church to freshmen in the adult age of the church. We are enlisted sergeants who have been field promoted to second lieutenants. We are all adapting to a significant change in our environment that brings disorientation and in some cases, a temporary loss of balance. Things that used to work great are now not working at all or with less effect. The Lord is revealing new things to us that are working better than we’ve ever seen before, all evidence of a corporate promotion. #transition #mature #seasons 

This reality can be very difficult for some people to come to terms with. In some cases there are those who attained positions of great authority in the adolescent age of the church (seniors), who now find their authority for moving the Church forward has radically reduced or even been removed. None of us were promoted to seniors, but some are destined to, and those will step up to the plate in the very near future.  #transition #seasons #authority #trust #journeying  #maturity 

Adult sons and daughters of the King have been sent by Jesus to do everything He was sent to do by the Father. Jesus was the prototype who replicated Himself through His multi-audience teachings. He taught to the infants in Christ, the toddlers, the pre-schoolers, middle childhoods, the pre-pubescent, adolescents, and the adults. But it was to the adult children that He taught to replace Him once He was gone. As individuals, this is an important part of understanding how our gifts will work to their full potential. But corporately, this means that the Church must get ready to be Christ on earth. We are to do everything that He did. By Himself, Jesus fulfilled [[Isaiah 61_1-2a\|Isa. 61:1-2a]]. The adult Church of Jesus Christ will finish this corporately: #sons-and-daughters #change #seasons #gifts

They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the display of his splendor. They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated; they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations. Aliens will shepherd your flocks; foreigners will work your fields and vineyards. And you will be called priests of the LORD, you will be named ministers of our God. You will*
