## Chapter 7: The Authority of Jesus

Status check: we have welcomed the Light of Jesus. All hidden evil, iniquities, and sins that the Lord wants us to deal with have been revealed. We have forgiven the people’s sins with the Blood of Jesus and the word of the testimony, canceling the rights of evil to fester. It is as if we have sprayed disinfectant cleaner on our bathtub to soak. The germs are now dead. They have lost all power of life to multiply, corrode, and stink. They have detached from the surface and are floating in a pool of the chemicals we have sprayed there. The last step is to scrub and wipe the scum away. Our tub will look bright, white, and shiny, as if we just got a new one!

### STRONGHOLDS OF DARKNESS

>*“For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds…” [[2 Corinthians 10_4\|2 Corinthians 10:4]]* #bible-verse 

We are at war. The enemy has power and is fighting a secret battle to deceive, divide, and destroy the people of God. Strongholds of darkness are built when the actions of humans are outside of the Will of the Father (sin). The evil one obtains the

right to steal the seeds of life sown into us by our Lord ([[Matthew 13_19\|Matt. 13:19]]). He plants weeds in their place that produce fruit for the kingdom of darkness ([[Matthew 13_25\|Matt. 13:25]]). He captures prisoners of war through accusation, shame, and condemnation. He keeps them locked up in deep, dark cells, as far away from the Light of Truth as he can. #bible-verse #sin #legal-right #kingdom-of-darkness #seed #accusation #shame 

We have already won this war ([[John 19_30\|John 19:30]]). When the sons and daughters of the King come with the Light, the prisoners are rescued and set free. All rights of the evil one are stripped through forgiveness by the Blood of Jesus. Accusation is cast down with the word of the testimony. They overcome the power of the enemy with the authority given to them by Jesus through the Holy Spirit. They resist the devil and he flees from them. The stronghold of darkness is shattered. #truth #blood #holy-spirit #maturity #testimony #authority #sons-and-daughters #royal-priest

>*“But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you. Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.”* *[[Matthew 12_28-29\|Matthew 12:28–29]]* #bible-verse 

Next we remove all demons from the person, place, or thing by casting them out and commanding them to go under our feet. The Lord commanded Aaron and his sons to wash themselves physically and spiritually before entering His Presence. We are spiritually washed clean by the Blood of Jesus. Physical washing comes when we remove the demons that are symbolized by dirt, bacteria, and viruses that make our bodies impure. When this is accomplished, we are done. The bathtub is clean. #authority #purification #forgiveness #blood-of-Jesus  #demon

>*[[Mark 9_25\| Mark 9:25]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus commanded demons not to ever return to the person he was freeing. He is teaching us that we have the authority to keep an unclean spirit from returning to the person that it has left. Our strategy for overcoming the power of the evil one is through forgiveness. When we forgive ([[Revelation 12_10-11\|Rev. 12:10-11]]), all rights of evil are stripped. The unclean spirit cannot return and bring "*with*

*him seven other spirits more wicked than himself *" ([[Matthew 12_45\|Matt. 12:45]]). His residence is overturned. The stronghold is destroyed. #bible-verse  #forgiveness #terraforming #authority  #jesus #heart-of-God #prayer #spirit #evil-one #purification #demon #authority 



This throws the enemy into confusion as the demons that have been at work on this person or in this place are permanently removed. Remembering that sins are passed to the third and fourth generation ([[Numbers 14_18\|Num. 14:18]]), demons move from parent to child. They get experienced at tormenting us and learn our “push buttons.” They get good at tempting us. When those demons are commanded to *enter him no more*, the advantage moves to our side. When we then command the enemy camp to forget this experience and never use it again against anyone in our family, this experience is lost forever. It becomes more difficult to tempt the person as only new, less experienced demons can come back to tempt the person. Not only are we free, but we get the upper hand in the war! #bible-verse #generational-sins #demon #generational-forgiveness #freedom #restoration  #temptation

### SEEDS OF EVIL

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.” [[Matthew 13_24-26\|Matthew 13:24-26]]* #bible-verse 

We have removed all demons from the person, place, or thing, but this does not mean that their influence is fully removed. Demons leave behind their excrement, their slime, and their seeds of evil that prevent cleanliness. The seeds are meant to grow and produce weeds that choke out the good wheat sown by our Father. All such impurities must be removed before they multiply like bacteria and begin to rot. This is critical to establish the clean environment that the Lord desires for His Presence. It is also a proactive strategy to prevent the long-term destruction of well-rooted, fruit-bearing implantations of evil. #demon #seed #purification 

“And suddenly there came a sound from Heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.” [[Acts 2_2–4\|Acts 2:2–4]]*

We welcome the Holy Spirit to come as of fire and sanctify the area by burning the impurities away. The fire consumes all power in what was left behind. We ask the Holy Spirit to come as of a rushing mighty wind and blow away the ashes. We welcome the Lord to come as water and carry away any remaining grime as with a flood. This completes the removal of any trace of evil. We have created an environment that is ceremonially clean for the Lord to come in. But first, we must complete the task of establishing His Kingdom. #bible-verse #holy-spirit #water #kingdom #purified 

### OFF-LIMIT ZONES

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the world's people, that enemies and foes could enter the gates of Jerusalem. But it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests...” [[Lamentations 4_12-13\|Lamentations 4:12-13]]* #bible-verse 

Demons want to sneak into our lives through the gates and doors that the Lord has established. When we sin, they obtain the right to do this. Through forgiveness with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony, these rights are stripped. We can then declare that these gates are now off-limits to the enemy camp and that no demon may enter through them or spy on us from outside. #gate #legal-right #sin #forgiveness #blood #jesus 

### STRONGHOLDS OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Thus Joshua took all this land: the mountain country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, and the Jordan plain*
*—the mountains of Israel and its lowlands, from Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir, even as far as Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, and struck them down and killed them.” [[Joshua 11_16-17\|Joshua 11:16-17]]* #bible-verse 

We have captured an enemy stronghold. In an aerial assault, the Blood of Jesus destroyed the power of the enemy. We must now convert the stronghold to one of ours. In the “mop up” phase, we sent in troops to shine the Light in all the dark places. Every enemy soldier we found was captured and subdued. We must now bring the rest of our Father’s army in to establish and hold

the new stronghold for the Kingdom of God. The King’s soldiers do not take orders from the King’s younger children. But they will take orders from those who have grown up and are walking in the authority given to them by the King. They will follow all of those whom they have been posted to by the King and who are fulfilling the King’s Will. #light #dark #His-will #maturity #authority #kingdom

>*“Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?” [[Hebrews 1_14\|Hebrews 1:14]]* #bible-verse 

The next step in Terraforming is to ask our Father for angels to support us. We do this as Jesus could have done in the garden of Gethsemane ([[Matthew 26_53\|Matt. 26:53]]). We set a perimeter around the outpost. We post sentry and sentinel angels at the gates or doors. We post guardian angels to each person and warring angels to fortify the stronghold. We establish a “demon-free zone” where no agents of evil may enter or obtain any information that can be used against the Kingdom of God. We place bindings in the angel’s hands and proclaim that all demons that interfere with the Will of the Father must be “left at the door.” We also welcome angels to minister to the hearts of the people that we will pray for. These we post just inside the entrance, after the sentry angels. This has a soothing effect on the people as they walk in the door. #bible-verse #angel #His-will #heart-of-God #terraforming  #authority 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and He delivers them.” [[Psalm 34_7\|Psalm 34:7]]* #bible-verse 

The Lord has brought confirmation to us of times that we have posted these angels through brethren that have discerned them in the spirit. One time we posted both a sentry and sentinel angel outside of a hospital room after praying over it, forgiving the previous occupants with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. After we left the patient’s Pastor came to visit. Walking in with a wide open mouth and a white complexion, the Pastor said, “There are two of the tallest angels I’ve ever seen standing right outside of your door!” The patient was very excited to hear this, realizing that the pastor could not have known that we posted these. #prayer #community #spirit #blood-of-Jesus #angel #testimony #discernment 

One day we posted four angels in a room where we were praying.  The Lord gave us these names, the angel of “mercy,”

“healing,” “anointing,” and “inheritance.” That day we had a guest who was observing our prayer time. We had only just met him. At the end of the prayer time he was grinning widely. I asked him to tell us what was going on, and he said, “there are four angels in this room!” He then pointed to the exact location where we posted each one. #angel #discernment #authority #testimony #prayer 

Another time we posted four warring angels around a building where we were holding a meeting. A man came and told us that he saw the angels at each corner of the property holding swords straight up into the sky! Where ever we go, we always ask the Lord about whether to establish a stronghold for the Kingdom of God through posting the angels He assigns us. The answer is usually, “yes!” and we do just that at His leading. #angel #authority #testimony
