## Chapter 4: The Light of Jesus

> [!quote]+ 
>*“You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the Light of Your Presence.”* *[[Psalm 90_8\| Psalm 90:8]]* #bible-verse 
>
>*“I am the Light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness, but will have the Light of life.” [[John 8_12b\| John 8:12b]]* #bible-verse 

Light is just not a good thing for the devil. When the foundation of your power is in your success as a liar, light is entirely inconvenient. Since Jesus took the keys of death and hades away, where does satan’s power come from? It comes from the choices and actions of the men and women on this earth that are created in the image of God. Being in His image, we have the power to choose, the power to create or destroy, the power to make judgments, and the power to forgive. And to get those choices to go his way, satan lies. If the lie is believed, he steals ( [[Matthew 13_19\|Matt. 13:19]]). And once he has stolen from us, he has power to kill and destroy ([[John 10_10\|John 10:10]]). #light-of-jesus #bible-verse #power 

It is a nasty crime. First, he comes as a wolf in sheep’s clothing, talking sweetly to us and convincing us to make poor choices. Once we’ve acted upon these, the accuser comes back with condemnation and guilt. Shame is next on the menu. The enemy wants us to hide in the dark with him. If we choose to sin, accept condemnation, and then hide our sin in the darkness we have willingly given power to the enemy to place us in prison for our crime. #choice

In every sense this goes against all that Jesus bought and paid for at a very high price. The most horrific part of this story is that most people, including many Christians, sit in these prisons on this very day. But there is good news (gospel). God has empowered His children to go and get them out. #choice #image #shame #guilt #dark #jesus 

### REVELATION

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock *[of revelation] *I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.” [[Matthew 16_17-18\|Matthew 16:17-18]]* #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through the revelation of Jesus Christ.” [[Galatians 1_11-12\|Galatians 1:11-12]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus spoke of revelation from the Father as being the foundation of His church. Paul experienced this firsthand as the wealth of understanding that was within him could only be attributed to revelation. This revelation comes from seeing and hearing the Truth as God speaks it into our hearts. The Lord wants to reveal to us all that is in our hearts, including all evil ([[Matthew 12_34\|Matt. 12:34]]), so we can be purified by the Blood of Jesus and made free. Our sins were never meant to be a secret, either from us or from our siblings in Christ ([[James 5_16\|James 5:16]]). *“But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin.” [[1 John 1_7\|1 John 1:7]]* #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“No more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the LORD.” [[Jeremiah 31_34a\| Jeremiah 31:34a]]* #bible-verse 

God’s decision to demonstrate His power through revelation is wondrous to behold. No matter where you are or in what state of being you find yourself, God is able to miraculously reach you through revelation. It is His way of calling to the lost, no matter where they are. He can do this. He is God.

I know of examples where God has supernaturally healed children stricken with disease that greatly impaired their mind and body. They have spoken clearly about what God said to them while they were sick. This says to me that there is no prison that can separate us from our Lord and Savior. God is merciful in His love for us. He knows His children and does not forsake them ever ([[Isaiah 41_17\|Isa. 41:17]]). #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.” [[1 Corinthians 2_9\|1 Corinthians 2:9]] / [[Isaiah 64_4 \| Isaiah 64:4]]* #bible-verse 

### TRUTH

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”  [[John 8_31-32\|John 8:31-32]]* #bible-verse

When we follow the Truth, we never walk in darkness. The lie says that if we are discovered, we will endure punishment or ramifications that will imprison us. As such, we should avoid the consequences by hiding what we’ve done. The lie wants us to have a worldly mentality that misses eternity. The Truth is that Jesus paid for all eternal punishment and consequence. Even if our actions on earth require physical punishment now (the imprisoned criminal that has just received the Lord), the eternal Truth is that we have been set free in Christ Jesus ([[Hebrews 9_15 \|Heb. 9:15]]). Our life on earth is a dot next to eternity in Heaven. The enemy does not want us to remember this. #bible-verse 

Jesus said that HE IS the Light ([[John 8_12\| John 8:12]]), the Truth, and the Way ([[John 14_6\| John 14:6]]). The freedom that Christ brought us is in being able to live according to God’s Standard and not the world’s standard. The world says that you must build treasures here on earth to be of value. These include good looks (no fat, all muscle, proportionate, etc), wealth, religiously admirable (in some cultures), or in other words, without flaw. God’s standard says that we are wonderfully made ([[Psalm 139_14\|Ps. 139:14]]) and can lay our treasures in heaven where moth, rust, and thieves cannot take them ([[Matthew 6_19 \|Matt. 6:19]]). The Truth is that we are eternal beings. The liar does not want us to live this way.  #freedom #truth #jesus #heaven #treasure #light #heart-of-God #bible-verse

### HIDDEN SINS

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'” [[Acts 26_17b-18\|Acts 26:17b-18]]* #bible-verse 

The enemy likes hidden sins. As long as the sins remains hidden, it cannot be dealt with through forgiveness. Satan does not want to lose any power and therefore is extremely motivated to keep the existence of sins in the dark. This can be through generational sins of forefathers long gone, or the sins that we have received shame for and have freely chosen to hide in the dark to prevent exposure. Our decision to place these sins in the Light of His Presence or to submit to His spirit of revelation, will greatly weaken the power of the enemy. #hidden #darkness #light 

When we began praying for people in Tulsa, we had amazing results for close to a year. But eventually we began to notice that with some people we reached a plateau over a period of time where the breakthroughs stopped. One day the Lord said to us, “*Ask Me to shine My Light on them*.” This was a foreign concept to us, but we gave it a try. We were dumbfounded. The person that we were praying for was someone we had been praying with for nearly a year. They were at one of these plateaus and not much had happened in some time.

As soon as we prayed in the Light, that person began to speak out to us many sins (committed by them and trespassed against them) that we had never heard before! It was as if a valve had been turned and the dam released. Over the next few weeks that person’s entire family was healed as a result of these confessions. The entire experience was wonderful for all and nothing short of a miracle for the person we were praying for. That same day we prayed for several other people with the same results. God was showing us that His Light brought things to the surface that needed to be released for a person to be set free. They were sins that the evil one was using as a right to torment and afflict these people. #forgiveness #terraforming #light #alignment #prayer #interceding #revelation #choice #invitation

### DAILY BREAD

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Give us today our daily bread.” [[Matthew 6_11\| Matthew 6:11]]* #bible-verse 

The next thing the Lord showed us was that the Light would reveal ALL hidden sins. This sounds like a good thing, but turned out to be overwhelming. There were so many sins being presented that we were unable to deal with them all before the person being prayed for was exhausted. The Lord showed us that there is a perfect sequence and a safe quantity that He knows to work in. We just need to yield to Him so we can receive it. #light-of-jesus #hidden #revelation #trust 

The Lord showed us to ask that He give that person their daily bread of His will done, which includes revelation, healing, and inheritance. By doing so, we are submitting to His process of freedom. This way the person being prayed for is not overwhelmed by too many revelations, nor short-changed by too little. They are also able to see the perfect efficiency of the Lord’s process whereby those things that must be dealt with first before others can be dealt with are handled accordingly. #daily-bread #His-will #freedom 

This is paramount to our lives in Christ. We must understand that God is “juggling” six and a half billion people created in His image with freewill. Each one of us makes countless decisions each day that affect much in creation. Because of this, we must trust Him to lead us to what is right in His perfect sequence, quantity, and timing. The Lord wants to sanctify us and set us free, but He knows the best way for this to happen. If we will yield to His daily allocation (our daily bread), we will see mighty things accomplished in our lives. #creation #daily-bread #prayer 


### TERRAFORMING WITH THE LIGHT

Terraformers ask the Lord to shine the Light of Jesus over, in, and through the person, place, or thing being prepared. We pray that the Light would cover the darkness and that there would be no shadows. The Light pours in through every crack and every crevice into the deepest places. We knock the lids off of any hiding places that the Light would rush in, revealing all secret sins and iniquities.

As led by the Holy Spirit, we sometimes ask that our Lord Jesus, Lion of the Tribe of Judah ([[Revelation 5_5\| Rev. 5:5]]) would come and prowl in that person’s life. The Lion will reveal all impurities in His Light as He roars at the darkness, shaking the house so everything that is not of Him will crumble ([[Hebrews 12_25-29\|Heb. 12:25-29]]). He pants in the ear of those that He loves, whispering all that is revealed in the Light. The Lord wants to see lives changed with the Truth (set the captives free), and when He comes, the Truth is made known. #bible-verse #light #reveal #truth 

If the heart of the person is soft, the fruit of the Truth will be confession. This should result in one or more reactions: repentance of sins, forgiveness of those that have trespassed against them, and obedience to God (changing your “no” to “yes”). Each circumstance will be different, but within all captivity is the need to do one or more of these things to be made truly free. #light #truth #trust #forgiveness #His-will 

We want to avoid “prophetic haywire” whereby we see or hear all things in the Spirit, many of which are not meant to be spoken-out at the time of your prayer. The Light will filter these things through daily bread and highlight only those that need to be dealt with now. When we pray, we need to be able to see things as God sees them. We want to operate within His Will. The Light will reveal these things to us. #holy-spirit #jesus #truth #light #forgiveness #prayer #daily-bread #His-will
