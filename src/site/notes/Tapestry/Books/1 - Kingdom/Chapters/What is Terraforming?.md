### What is Terraforming?

Power and authority are given to [[Tapestry/WIKI/Articles/satan\|satan]] and [[kingdom of darkness\|his kingdom]] every time we freely choose to [[sin\|sin]]. This is the motivation for the evil one to lie, steal, kill, and destroy to get humans to believe that their choices are founded in [[Truth\|Truth]], when they are not. These sins are presented in heaven (court room) by the [[accuser\|accuser]] (plaintiff) against all of mankind (defendant) day and night. #sin #satan #accuser #kingdom-of-darkness #power #authority #choice #court-room #legal-right #heaven

As the [[Tapestry/WIKI/Articles/Light of Jesus\|Light of Jesus]] reveals the root sin, [[Tapestry/WIKI/Articles/royal priests\|royal priests]] strip evil of these rights by [[Full Forgiveness\|fully forgiving]] the person who sinned, sprinkling them with the [[Tapestry/WIKI/Articles/blood of Jesus\|blood of Jesus]]. The accuser is then hurled down by the [[word of their testimony\|word of their testimony]], which describes what the blood of Jesus did for the sinner: they are [[Full Forgiveness\|purified of all unrighteousness, redeemed of every debt, and restored near to God]]. #sin #satan #accuser #kingdom-of-darkness #light-of-jesus #word-of-testimony #sin #root #royal-priest #legal-right #full-forgiveness #purification #redemption #restoration #authority-of-christ #freedom #reconciliation 

It is with this [[Authority of Christ\|authority of Jesus]] that royal priests dismantle the kingdom of darkness, thereby setting the captives free. The people of God can then gather these newly freed disciples (learners), impart to them the [[Gospel\|Gospel of Jesus Christ]], and then release them into their [[irrevocable gifts and callings\|irrevocable gifts and callings]] for which Christ Jesus took ahold of them. When this happens across the entire world, creation will be reformed, or (“_terra”_ - _Latin :_ _earth_) (“_forma”_ - _Latin :_ _molded_), Terraformed for the Kingdom of God. #kingdom-of-darkness #authority-of-christ #terraforming #royal-priest #freedom #discipleship #creation #gospel

As royal priests, we are preparing creation (people, places, things) for His [[God's Presence\|Presence]] through His Light ([[Tapestry/Bible/Psalms/Psalm 43_3\|Psalm 43:3]]), His Blood ([[Tapestry/Bible/Hebrews/Hebrews 10_19\|Hebrews 10:19]]), and His Authority ([[Tapestry/Bible/John/John 20_21\|John 20:21]]). #bible-verse #royal-priest #creation #presence-of-god #blood-of-Jesus #light-of-jesus #authority-of-christ #terraforming
