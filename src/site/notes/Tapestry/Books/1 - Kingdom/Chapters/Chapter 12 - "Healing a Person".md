## Chapter 12: Healing a Person

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.” [[Matthew 10_8\|Matthew 10:8]]* #bible-verse 

The Father sent Jesus with the power and authority to heal the sick. Now Jesus has sent us to do the same. Throughout the last 100 years, this understanding has been restored to the Church and most believers agree that healing is within the Will of God. The question that arises is why are some healed while others are not. Is it the Will of God for everyone to be healed? We know that by His wounds that trickled with Blood (*greek : molops*), we are healed ([[1 Peter 2_24\|1 Pet. 2:24]]). So why do people still suffer from cancer? #bible-verse #greek #molops #His-will 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Some men brought to Him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, ‘Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.’ At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, ‘This fellow is blaspheming!’”* [[Matthew 9_2-3\|Matthew 9:2-3]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus demonstrated two basic types of healing while He was on earth. The first was based upon forgiveness. We call this a “**Matthew 9**” type healing. When Jesus came to the paralytic, He saw that they had faith and then declared that the sins of the man were forgiven. This was quite a bold statement made by the man from Nazareth. The Jewish pharisees of the time were in shock, and although they said nothing, Jesus knew their thoughts. Jesus’ response that “*the Son of Man has authority on*

*earth to forgive sins*” was equally as brazen. Let’s break down this type of healing into smaller parts for better understanding. #His-will #blood #jesus #healed #healing #forgiveness 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.” [[Matthew 8_10\|Matthew 8:10]]* #bible-verse 

First, Jesus saw that they had faith. Almost every specific healing mentioned in the gospels references the presence of, or lack of faith in the people. There are two sides to faith, the first is __belief__ that comes from divine revelation. Jesus saw this kind of faith in the centurion. The man was a Gentile (hence Jesus’ reference to people coming from the east and west) and knew little about the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Yet he knew the power of Jesus with divine insight. The Canaanite woman from Tyre and Sidon ([[Matthew 15_21-28\|Matt. 15:21-28]]) had the same faith. She believed through divine revelation, Jesus recognized it, and her daughter was delivered. #bible-verse #faith #power #jesus 

The next side of faith is a __lack of deception__. In Matthew 9, Jesus saw that the paralytic had received revelation from the Lord as to the specific sin that caused him to be paralyzed and that he had a repentant heart. Many of us have sin in our lives that comes from our choices or the choices of our forefathers. The enemy does not want us to know about these and will deceive us to keep us from dealing with them. Either we have agreed with the enemy and hardened our hearts towards repentance, or we don’t know about them because they were the sins of our parents, grandparents, or great grandparents. Once Jesus saw this kind of faith, all that was left was for Him to forgive! #faith #revelation #heart #generational-sins #forgiveness 

Thirdly, Jesus did not say that the Son of God had authority on earth to forgive sins, but the Son of Man. Filled with the Holy Spirit, Jesus was authorized to bring forgiveness to the paralytic. Some may ask, if there is no forgiveness without the shedding of Blood, how did Jesus do this? The Holy Spirit within Jesus is outside of time. Jesus was bringing the Will of the Father to earth as it is in heaven when He forgave this man before His Blood was shed! Hurling down the accuser is the function of the adult age of His Church, so Jesus saved this for when John’s book of *“what must soon take place” *([[Revelation 1_1\|Rev. 1:1]]) was to be fulfilled. #bible-verse #son-of-man #His-will #blood-of-Jesus

We have seen many Matthew 9 healing examples over the last few years. Earlier in 2009 we were at a conference where we met a woman who requested prayer for cancer. We put together a team and took her into a private room for prayer. When we started, the Lord gave me a sensation in my right lymph node. I asked her what this might mean and she said, “the doctors believe that this cancer has moved into my lymph nodes, and if so, it is terminable.” 

We continued to pray and the Lord gave me a vision of a male in her family with a freemason apron on speaking idolatrous oaths and vows. As he spoke them his throat was being permeated with a black ooze. It was defiling him and causing disease in his throat. I asked her if she knew of any freemasons in her family, and she said, “Yes, my grandfather was a freemason. He has since passed away.”   #holy-spirit #forgiveness #blood #His-will  #generational-sins #freemasons 
 
I led her through forgiving her grandfather by sprinkling him with the Blood of Jesus. She spoke out the testimony that all curses were broken and that the defilement of idolatry was washed away. We were clear that all witchcraft was dismantled, unraveled, undone, and rendered powerless. We hurled down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of his testimony. As we prayed this she began to glow. Literally. It was as if Light was radiating out of her. #blood-of-Jesus #forgiveness #washed #witchcraft #dismantle 

When we stopped praying she began to make a fist out of her left hand and stare at it with shock. Not understanding, I asked if everything was OK. She said that she had arthritis and that she had not been able to make a fist for ten years! God had healed the arthritis in her left hand while she was declaring the forgiveness of her grandfather. Later that week she went to the doctor for a test. When the results came back, there was a problem. They could find no trace of cancer in her body! This is a Matthew 9 healing. The root sin was revealed in the Light of His Presence. With the authority of the Holy Spirit within us, the sinner was forgiven and the sin washed away. All rights of the evil one to torment her with cancer were stripped. She was healed completely. #forgiveness #healing #healed #root #sin #light #testimony #prayer

>*was born blind?’ ‘Neither this man nor his parents sinned,’ said Jesus, ‘but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.’”  [[John 9_1-3\|John 9:1-3]]* #bible-verse 

The second type of healing has nothing to do with forgiveness. We call this a **John 9 **type healing. This type is a supernatural miracle that occurs so the work of God will be displayed in a person’s life. The disciples asked Jesus whose sin caused the illness not because of their mistaken theology, but because that was why everyone else they had seen healed was sick in the first place!

Most healing examples that we see today, however, are Matthew 9 types. It is imperative that the Church understand this to avoid accusing God of not loving, rejecting, or abandoning them. This is not the case! The problem is that we have 100 years of recent history where highly anointed people healed by asking the Lord for an instantaneous, supernatural healing (John 9). These healing examples are very dramatic and send a clear message that God is in the healing business. #healing #forgiveness #rejection #abandoning #favorites #supernatural 

The Azuza Street Revival and its offspring brought healing back into the limelight at the turn of the twentieth century. In the 1940’s, ministers such as Oral Roberts, William Branham, and Kathryn Kuhlman saw the anointing for healing explode. But as these ministries began to track their own fruit, it became apparent that a small number of the people that they prayed for were healed by praying this way. Most figures indicate that one to five percent of people are healed instantaneously through what we call a John 9 healing. #revival #revelation #healed #prayer

That does not demean what was accomplished. God wanted to reintroduce His supernatural power back into the Church and did so with great impact. It is important that we make room for God to heal instantaneously every time we pray for someone! He is God and He heals this way today! In the same month that we prayed for the woman who was healed of arthritis and cancer, we attended a separate conference. At the end we asked everyone who wanted to be healed to come for prayer. There were three of us praying, and 21 people who wanted prayer, so we each took seven people. #healing #prayer #supernatural

The first person I prayed for was standing on my right side. She told me that her knee had been injured 20 years ago. She had endured seven surgeries to date with no success and was still in pain. I started to pray and all of a sudden I saw my left hand catch on Fire in the spirit. This gift of seeing is new, so I was very surprised! The vision only lasted for a second, but the heat of the fire continued for some time. Not knowing what else to do, I threw my left hand on her knee and asked the Lord to heal her. #healing #prayer 

The person on my left side had a varicose vein that was so painful, she could not sleep at night. I asked a female next to her to lay hands on the vein, and then I put my left hand (still on fire) on her hand. I asked the Lord to heal the vein and the pain instantaneously stopped! Praise God!!! At this very moment, the lady on my right with the painful knee grabbed me by the shirt and yelled, “THANK YOU!!!” and ran off. I then prayed for three ladies for various needs including issues with grandchildren, husbands, and employment. #prayer #gift #vision #spirit #testimony 

Later I spoke to the lady with the painful knee. She told me that when I prayed the pain left her leg for the first time in 20 years! When it happened, she was so in shock that she could not say anything to me. The shock wore off and she was jumping up and down all around the room, laughing, crying, and thanking the Lord! We praised His Name for the rest of the night, celebrating the goodness of God. Every person prayed for that day was healed. #healing  #testimony 

Both the lady with the painful knee, and the lady with the varicose vein were healed according to what is written in John 9. No one was forgiven, they simply believed that God could heal them and they were. God anointed me with a hand of Fire to lay on their wounds and we saw the work of God displayed in their lives. While we have seen many of these types of healing examples, most of the people that we’ve seen healed over the last two to three years have been through the forgiveness of sins, hurling down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. #testimony #faith #healing #forgiveness #blood-of-Jesus

### KINSMAN-REDEEMERS

> [!quote]+ 
>*"The LORD bless him!" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. "He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead." She added, "That man is our close relative; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers. [[Ruth 2_20\|Ruth 2:20]]* #bible-verse

With the release of the authority to hurl down the accuser, the Church has been given a great gift from God. For thousands of years the human race has been paying the price for the sins of our forefathers. Modern scientists recognized this as hereditary or genetic illness (mental or physical) that is passed through the DNA from parent to child. In the Kingdom of God, we know that these are the result of sins that are punishable for three to four generations. #authority #accuser #generational-sins #kingdom #gift 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“'The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.'” [[Numbers 14_18\|Numbers 14:18]]* #bible-verse

Generational sins, iniquities, and memories are passed down to children from their forefathers. The impact to these children can be devastating in the form of behavioral sins, physical illness, mental illness, and demonic oppression. The worst of these come from sins of defilement which include bloodshed, broken covenant, idolatry (witchcraft has the worst impact), and sexual immorality (incest has the worst impact). The children grow up and find themselves struggling with issues such as anger, fear, torment, lust, depression, and a laundry list of ailments. #generational-sins #defilement #broken-covenant #witchcraft #anger #fear #lust 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.”* [[1 Peter 1_18-19\|1 Peter 1:18-19]]* #bible-verse

The Blood of Jesus brings redemption to the world to strip evil of its rights to manifest from these sins. When we forgive our forefathers by sprinkling them with the Blood of Jesus, they are purified and they are redeemed. So then are their children.  #covenant #redemption #blood #jesus #purified

When we speak out the word of this testimony, the accuser is hurled down and the legal rights are stripped.

> [!quote]+ 
>*“No Ammonite or Moabite or any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD, even down to the tenth generation.” [[Deuteronomy 23_3\|Deuteronomy 23:3]]* #bible-verse 

As with all Terraforming, the prayer is led by the Holy Spirit. We ask Him which generation of forefathers to start with and then go down from there to the person we are praying for. Under extreme cases we have started at the 20th generation, and found sins that gave rights to demons to afflict them. In a few cases we have prayed, “all the way back to Adam.” But with most cases, the Lord leads us to start at the fourth (4th) generation. The prayer essentially looks like this:  #terraforming #legal-right #holy-spirit #generational-sins #demons

*“Father I forgive my great-grandparents. I sprinkle them with the Blood of Jesus that the power of their sins are broken.”* #sample-prayer 

If there is no highlight from the Holy Spirit (physical, spiritual, or mental alarms going off), you can move on to the next generation. When a highlight occurs, continue with this prayer:

*“All sins of defilement: bloodshed, broken covenant, idolatry, and sexual immorality are washed away. Are curses are broken. All covenants of evil are dissolved. All witchcraft is dismantled, unraveled, and undone. It is rendered powerless to harm us. We are purified of all unrighteousness, redeemed of all consequences, and restored to the men and women of God that we were created to be. I ask you, Father to remember our sins no more. I hurl down the accuser against my family with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony.”* #sample-prayer 

Continue on to each generation. Note that the third (3rd) generation is their grandparents, and the second (2nd) generation are their parents. All first generation forgiveness is repentance of personal sins, or forgiveness of a sibling. These sins do not meet the definition of “generational sins” and therefore the first generation is not terraformed as a part of the kinsman-redeemer process. #prayer #covenant #forgiveness #generational-sins #generational-forgiveness #kinsman-redeemer

### SOUL TIES

> [!quote]+ 
>*“After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself.”* [[1 Samuel 18_1\|1 Samuel 18:1]]* #bible-verse

Many Christians today are familiar with the concept of a “soul tie” or the knitting of two souls together as a result of a love bond. Within the context of marriage, these are intended and beautiful. Parents can have healthy soul ties with their children, called “bonding.” For the most part, these are manifestations of the Love that God created between two people and should be honored. When soul ties result from sin (fornication, idolatry, manipulation, etc.), they can be very damaging. It is possible to see the sins of one person become a stronghold of another person due to an unhealthy soul tie.   #soul-tie #love #sin  #redemption #defilement #idolatry 

The best way to break these is first to repent of your sin and forgive the other person involved with the soul tie. By hurling down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony, you break the power of the tie so it can be undone. Next you return the other persons soul, washed with the Blood of Jesus. Equally, you call back your own soul, also washed with the Blood of Jesus. This last step is often overlooked and is critical to returning each person to the state of wholeness they were in before, and with the redemption of the Blood in full effect. #forgiveness  #accuser #soul-tie #blood-of-Jesus

### SADISTIC RITUAL ABUSE (SRA)

Throughout history, satan has proven that he is void of love. No greater example exists than when humans freely choose to serve him. The resulting fruit can make a horror movie seem like child’s play. When a human becomes a servant of evil, which is the ultimate glorification of self, they are handing to the evil one

their power to create and to destroy. You see this through witchcraft and all of its esoteric, occultist, and false-religion activities. The results are horrific.  #choice #witchcraft #evil-one 

Satan has formalized his process of leeching power from humans through ancient rituals. These can be found in pre-flood hedonism, and in every Assyrian, Sumerian, Babylonian, Mayan, Celtic, and ancient Chinese religion since the flood. Some are worse than others. The absolute worst involve the infliction of trauma through pain, suffering, humiliation, and sometimes the death of innocent victims. Today we refer to these as Sadistic Ritual Abuses (SRAs). They are hidden from the public view, often conducted by people of renown / heroes of old (those with influence), and are covered up and renounced by the secular psychiatric community. #love #choice #evil-one #witchcraft #SRA #not-love 

The victims are usually, but not always, children aged 5 - 10. The ritual is conducted in a dark place that almost always includes the shedding of blood (animal or human) and some sort of sexual humiliation (physical violation or forced oral). The objective is severe trauma that silences the person and renders them docile or even willing to accept future abuses. In our experiences, the involvement of a “trusted” family member is especially common. The worst case SRA will include a human sacrifice, consumption of blood, and a marriage to satan himself. The resulting stronghold is massive, complex, and brings utter destruction to the person’s life. The legal right of all evil to manifest on earth comes from the freewill choices of humans to rebel against the will of God. #kingdom-of-darkness #choice #not-love #rituals #SRA #legal-right #bloodshed #defilement 

To strip evil of its right to manifest, we fully forgive those humans who chose to rebel against God. As the hidden sins are revealed in the Light of His Presence, we cast down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony by forgiving the sinners. The time this process takes depends upon how much sin is revealed as a part of the victim’s daily bread given to them by God. Once the sins are forgiven and the strongholds shattered, we next yield to God’s timing and sequence for the healing of the person’s soul. God is very patient when it comes to the healing of a person afflicted by evil. He wants to deal with every part of us, our spirit, soul, and body.

As such He heals us over time giving us each day what we can handle until the job is done. Through this process we have seen numerous people regain normal function within a few sessions. After a few months, they have declared themselves healed. This is truly amazing given the severity of the trauma. Praise God for this breakthrough! #rituals #SRA  #blood #evil-one #satan #freedom #choice #sin #light-of-jesus  #forgive #daily-bread #testimony
