## Chapter 18: Dismantling

*“‘In that day,’ declares the LORD, ‘I will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots. I will destroy the cities of your land and tear down all your strongholds. I will destroy your witchcraft and you will no longer cast spells. I will destroy your carved images and your sacred stones from among you; you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands. I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles and demolish your cities. I will take vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations that have not obeyed me.’”* [[Micah 5_10-15\|Micah 5:10-15]] #bible-verse 

There are two ways of dismantling anything. The first is to take it apart the way it was put together. This is the safe way of dismantling as it limits any collateral damage. But it requires that you understand each step of the creation process whereby you can perform these steps in reverse. The extra time it takes to understand the construction can be a nuisance, but it is well worth the effort. This kind of dismantling is preferred if there is any chance of your changing your mind during or after the procedure. #dismantle 

The second way of dismantling is to demolish. Far more destructive by nature, demolition is knocking, beating, crushing, or exploding something into smaller parts. By definition this requires no knowledge of the object’s construction unless you

are attempting an efficient demolition process, and thereby not using excessive force. It is generally understood that demolition is a permanent form of dismantling, therefore changing one’s mind during or after the process is futile. You will probably get laughed at.  #dismantle 

The Lord is calling us to undertake a combination both of these. We are learning all about the objects of our dismantling as if we were going to take them apart the way they were put together. We are obtaining an expert level of understanding about their inner workings, how they were put together, and why. With this knowledge we are called to demolish the objects, but to do so with wisdom so as to maximize the sinner’s safety. This chapter discusses the process whereby we will begin the dismantling project. Everyone is invited to participate. We need your eyes. #calling #invitation 

The Lord gave us an excellent outline in Micah 5 about what we will be dismantling. The enemy has cities, strongholds, horses and chariots, witchcraft, and god status to its advantage. All of these were granted to them through their deception of humans, who in turn have sinned and given the evil ones puppet strings with which to control their power to create. We know that it is simple for us to shut all of this down: when the Light reveals the roots, we forgive the sinners with the Blood of the Lamb and then hurl down the accuser with the word of our testimony. #defilement #choice #deception #light-of-jesus  #root #forgiveness 

Each of these demonic advantages (cities, strongholds, horses, etc) are described in the natural to give us a picture of what they are, but they truly exist in the spirit. Our natural eyes may not be able to see them, but they are there, are used for empowering and cementing into existence the kingdom of darkness, and must be dismantled. It is with these weapons of warfare that the enemy has been launching attacks and counter-attacks of torment and affliction on the body of Christ for thousands of years. Let’s get to know more about how they are constructed so we can dismantle them safely. Here are some examples to get us started:

### Land

> [!quote]+ 
>*or authorities; all things were created by Him and for Him.” [[Colossians 1_16\|Colossians 1:16]]* #bible-verse 

Demonic cities are similar, yet differentiated from cities in the natural. Think of old town hall meetings to get a decent picture of what these are. Demons gather together in rank from lowest to highest to discuss strategy, receive orders, and carry out missions. Please do not have a picture of organized, clean, military-like control in this environment. It looks more like a dark cavern of creepy, crawling, chaos. The city I discovered under Las Vegas, Nevada comes to mind. There are literally millions of demons in a city of this size, working together and yet not working together, if you know what I mean. They follow orders, but each has its own agenda. #demon #supernatural #discernment 

Most if not all cities in the natural have demonic counterparts in the spirit. These “sister cities” are built from the sin of the people in the natural. A good analogy comes from ants. If you leave solid food or spilt liquids on the countertop, ants will gather. This is especially true with demons. Where the sin (their food) is, they will gather. It is like moths to light. The two literally go hand in hand. There are different levels of sin that attract demons. The most authority found in these cities comes from sins of defilement which include the following: #demon #sin  #supernatural 

1. Bloodshed	[[Ezekiel 36_18\|Ezekiel 36:18]] #bible-verse 
2. Broken Covenant	[[2 Samuel 21_1-2,14\|2 Samuel 21:1-2,14]] #bible-verse 
3. Idolatry (includes witchcraft)	[[Jeremiah 16_18\|Jeremiah 16:18]] #bible-verse 
4. Sexual immorality	[[Leviticus 18_6-25\|Leviticus 18:6-25]] #bible-verse 

Demonic cities are further strengthened by the human drones. These are usually voluntary slaves, that is, witches, warlocks, and high priests. They are purposefully acting to build the city into an empire. The asherah poles of old were set by the pagan priests to set the boundaries and perimeters of the demonic city. They are found in the “highest of hills, and the lowest of valleys” to establish three dimensional territory. #watcher #demonic-stronghold #witchcraft 

Remember that demons do not create, they pervert. The land belongs to the Lord and the Kingdom of God, so all blessings in the land were put in place by Him. These are meant to work in tandem with the irrevocable gifts God gives His children. When

walking in alignment with the blessings in the land, we will see a magnification of the impact of our calling on earth. The evil one knows this and targets cities and people according to the gifts they have been given by God. Knowing that these are irrevocable, satan has lured people into using them for evil instead of Love.   #demons  #kingdom #gifts #alignment #earth #evil-one #not-love #supernatural 

An example of this can be found in New Orleans, Louisiana. Here is a city with a land blessing for prophesy. It is also a port city, and is therefore a gate of goods into the United States. In the spirit, New Orleans is a gate for prophetic words into our country. There are few U.S. cities with more organized, blatant operations of witchcraft. Here we find many gifted humans that have been deceived into conducting acts of defilement, especially idolatry and sexual immorality. The extensive demonic activity here is true in the natural city, but is also true in the size, scope, and power of the spiritual city that has been built. The enemy camp is using New Orleans as a valve to control the United States. Things look dire in our time here on earth. But in heaven, it is already done. Our Father has a plan to redeem New Orleans. The time is soon.  #gate #supernatural #witchcraft #defilement 

Demolishing demonic cities requires great authority. Although an individual adult man or woman of God who has received significant authority through a track record of hurling down the accuser can inflict a multiplier of destruction to evil, the Lord wants us to work together. Here He commands a blessing (Psalm 133). This is why the dismantling project requires the body of Christ to receive the key and begin working together to pull these cities down. #authority #unity #communion #dismantle #heart-of-God 

With everything in Terraforming, the Lord wants us to start in our own furrow. Terraforming cities requires that multiple people with high authority in the natural city (natural born residents first, transplants second) to gain authority from Terraforming their own lives. Then they can gather together in unity and Terraform their city. The important thing is to de- emphasize time. Demons obtain defilement rights and don’t lose them until the sinner is forgiven. The grace of God has overridden this in the past, but now we must change our ways ([[Acts 17_30\|Acts 17:30]]). We are wholly dependent upon the Light of Jesus to reveal the hidden sins going back in time to completely

dismantle a demonic city. With the right team of people, ordained by God, it can be done quickly and surely when the sinners are forgiven and the accuser hurled down. #forgiveness #rescue 

Tearing these down is easy in the Light, but you must be careful. The success of demons has been in stealth and deception, mainly through patiently waiting for the right opportunity to trip the warriors of Love that are battling against them. Loopholes of sin in our lives give them this target of attack. This is why we must Terraform ourselves first, and always walk in holiness. Be above reproach at all times. The health, prosperity, and sometimes the life of you and those close to you could be at risk. Keep your full armor of God on at all times (salvation, righteousness, truth, peace, faith) and you will be protected.  #dismantle #rescue #authority #adult-season #terraforming #terraformer #forgiveness #light #jesus #hidden #revelation  #truth #salvation #supernatural 

### Government

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.” [[Genesis 11_4\|Genesis 11:4]]* #bible-verse 

In the natural, the Assyrian empire worshiped handmade idols, pagan gods (demons) that they conducted detestable practices towards (bloodshed, sexual immorality) in their devotion. The authority that empowers this hierarchy comes from the unified sin of human community. When the government of that community and the agreeing majority of its inhabitants enter into corporate sin and makes it their religion, these demonic principalities receive a massive amount of rights, power, and authority to exist. #worship #demons #authority #religion #legal-right  

> [!quote]+ 
>*“‘Don't be afraid,’ the prophet answered. ‘Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.’ And Elisha prayed, ‘O LORD, open his eyes so he may see.’ Then the LORD opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.” [[2 Kings 6_16-17\|2 Kings 6:16-17]]* #bible-verse 


In the natural, the Assyrian armies rode horses pulling powerful chariots. The angelic army of God rides horses, pulling chariots of fire. These horses and chariots are assigned to the angels by the Lord as a part of their calling. As such, fallen angels ride them too. The big difference is that the chariots no longer house

the fire of God. These are sometimes used by the Lord for judgement ([[Zechariah 6_1-8\|Zech. 6:1-8]]). As with carved idols, these devices are symbolism of the demonic chain of command that is within the system of the kingdom of darkness. These are massive power houses that fall under the authority of countries, regions, and ultimately to the devil who is satan ([[Job 1_7\|Job 1:7]]). #bible-verse   #angels #demons #kingdom #darkness #satan #evil-one 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the One who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.” [[1 John 4_4\|1 John 4:4]]* #bible-verse

But do not be afraid. Those who are with us are more than those who are with them. The highest level of government within the kingdom of darkness stands upon the deception of its lying tongue. It is a house of cards. One pull and down it goes. As the body of Christ unifies in purpose, walking on the paths of our destinies with the fullness of our gifts, we see victory. The Light of Jesus reveals the hidden sins in daily portions that are the perfect quantity and sequence. We forgive the sinners, hurling down the accuser, and the hierarchy is demolished. #kingdom #darkness #deception #unity #daily-bread #revelation #light-of-jesus

In its place, the Lord will establish His government, a royal government that rests on the shoulders of King Jesus. This government consists of the adult sons and daughters of God who have an intimate relationship with their Father and operate out of a Kingdom heart. They are trustworthy to bring Love to those that need it most. They are servants who are not too proud to clean the toilets. Through Christ within them, they will embody all that Jesus was on earth: they will set the captives free and then release them on the path of their calling in the Kingdom.  #church #destiny #gifts #light #jesus #accuser #freedom #sons-and-daughters #intimacy #love #relationship #heart #heart-of-God

There is a war coming between the army of Love and the army of not-Love. Before any war can take place, there has to be preparations made to ready each side for the coming attack. Both sides are adding to their numbers both to populate the Kingdom and the kingdom and to build the armies. It is a tug of war for the hearts of human beings. There are several “push buttons” up for grabs right now, but the biggest ones are the basic needs for survival and desire for the supernatural. #love #not-love #kingdom #choice #heart #supernatural 

Recognizing these, the kingdom of darkness is rolling out its advertising program full-time. The first half of this is a recruiting promotion that has infiltrated many outlets, but none greater than the arts, especially movies. The Lord has shown us witchcraft being performed over movies when they are being made, unbeknownst to most of the movie makers. These leave seeds of evil implanted within the film itself, portals whereby the demonic hierarchies can lure unsuspecting candidates into the kingdom of darkness. They always target people by their irrevocable gifts that can be used to maximize dark power by geographical region. I will not name names, but there are several movies out that have these. We have detected the portals and have shut them down in the spirit. #kingdom-of-darkness  #heart #witchcraft #gifts #spirit #supernatural #seed #root #foundation #gate  

Most of the recruiting activities are centered around the supernatural. By enticing dreamers to join up through fantasies of sugar coated power, they are building an army with furious speed. The time to intervene is now. The kingdom of darkness is also planning more terrorist attacks, financial system failures, and even witchcraft to control the weather for more devastation that can bring about the need for basic things that they will provide to all those who join up. Those who do not (loyal Christians) would be dealt with ruthlessly. #deception #kingdom-of-darkness #supernatural #not-love 

The Kingdom of God offers eternal Love that brings indescribable fulfillment to a person. When your condition changes from not love to Love, it is quite dramatic. Pain and sorrow, fear and anger, hunger and thirst are replaced with peace, joy, happiness, and contentment. Your basic needs are not only met, but far exceeded. We also serve an omnipotent God ([[Luke 1_37\|Luke 1:37]]). He created the universe and holds it all in the palm of His hand. When the time comes, the people of God will see things

never dreamt of in human history. Those that desire to walk in the supernatural will certainly see it done and then some. #bible-verse  #supernatural #kingdom #god #love #fullness #provision #choice 

The theme with all dismantling projects is that the adult sons and daughters of God must unify together to build the authority needed to shut down the demonic hierarchies, cities in the spirit, and corporate witchcraft. As we are called to this we will lay down our lives, giving 100% of ourselves to the Lord. We will build an intimate relationship with God where we trust Him with everything, even to the risk of “heresy.” We will lose all that we’ve had in a great pruning process (including all importance in the body of Christ). We will then begin the process of building personal authority when we submit to the Light of Jesus in a daily walk of sanctification. We will offer and receive the Blood of the Lamb and hurl down the accuser with the word of our testimony. Then we will be ready to do the same for others. #dismantle #adult-season #sons-and-daughters #authority #spirit #witchcraft #intimacy #trust #church #light #blood-of-Jesus  #accuser #testimony 

### Process

With all Terraforming, we are turning to the Lord for guidance. We ask the Lord to shine His Light to reveal the hidden sins that the evil one is using as legal rights to operate. Once these have been revealed we move on to the fullness of forgiveness, where we hurl down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. In this stage, the person(s) that sinned, which can be ourselves, are forgiven. No matter what you are Terraforming, there is always a root sin and always a sinner that needs to be forgiven. With any given person that is being forgiven, there can be multiple back stories that need to be addressed. The following are four most common groups of people “behind the scenes” that should be considered when forgiving: #terraforming #terraformer #light-of-jesus #root #layer #forgiveness 

1. The person who sinned that you are forgiving (root person)
2. That person’s forefathers to the 4th generation (parents, grandparents, great-grandparents)
3. Anyone that person has been in covenant with (spouse, siblings, cousins, business partners)
4. Those that have trespassed against that person

Once these people have been forgiven with the Blood of the Lamb, we get to speak out the word of their testimony. It is by the power of the Blood that our words of dismantling are effective. Now when we say that a curse is broken, it is broken. The Holy Spirit will teach us and guide us to speak out those things that must be specifically identified to be fully rendered powerless. Therefore we can say “all curses are broken” generically if led, or “the Midianite curse is broken” if the Holy Spirit reveals this to be the case. The same goes for defilements. We can generically list, “all bloodshed, all broken covenants” or we can list specific examples if the Lord reveals these to us through prophetic pictures, memories, or signatures. #dismantle #light #evil-one #legal-right #holy-spirit #broken-covenant #revelation #generational-sins #generational-forgiveness 

### Signatures

A signature is a manifestation in the body of something that exists in the spirit. Often times this is pain in the body, specifically located in an area that describes the legal right the enemy has to torment or afflict the person with mental, emotional, or even physical sickness. In the process of receiving the revelation of these roots by the Holy Spirit in the Light of Jesus, we sometimes pick these up, translate them, forgive the person, and see total freedom or healing in the person we are praying for. These are easy to miss when you are first learning about them. Your mind can just pass them off as coincidence. But once you’ve been walking in the Light for awhile, you learn that there are few coincidences, if any. #legal-right #root #prayer 

One recent example started as pain in my lymph node. When I asked the person I was praying for if it meant anything to them, they indicated that they had been diagnosed with cancer in the very lymph node I had pain in. The Lord then gave me a picture of a forefather of that person speaking out masonic oaths. I ask them who this was and it turned out to be their grandfather. We forgave the grandfather, hurling down the accuser and dismantling the witchcraft. That person was immediately healed of arthritis in their hand. They had not been able to make a fist for 10 years, but suddenly could! A few days later during a final exam before therapy, the doctors identified that the cancer had disappeared from the body! Praise God! #generational-sins #generational-forgiveness #revelation #healing #testimony #witchcraft #legal-right #prayer #dismantle #discernment

Another example occurred during prayer. I felt a sharp pain in the sole of my right foot. We had just identified that the parents of this person were from Jamaica and we had sensed voodoo involvement. We forgave the family members, hurling down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. I then asked the person to sit down and lift up their right leg. I pulled the voodoo doll pin out of the right foot (in the spirit) and immediately the person’s right knee was healed after a failed surgery nine months previous had left them in great pain! #spirit  #revelation #root #holy-spirit  #generational-forgiveness #dismantle #witchcraft #healed #prayer #supernatural #discernment 

### Full Armor of God

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.” [[Ephesians 6_13\|Ephesians 6:13]]* #bible-verse 

Pain is no fun. No one that I know likes it. But pain reveals problems in the body, and many times, problems in the soul and the spirit as well. When a headache comes, we all reach for the aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen or some combination of the three. Yet does covering this God-given symptom in the darkness bring healing or hiding? Perhaps we should all take a second look at this practice and start turning to God and asking the most important part: “why?” #soul #spirit #revelation 

When praying for a person that is afflicted with the plans of the enemy, pain can be a good source of revelation about why the affliction is taking place. The Holy Spirit will sometimes reveal pictures and words of knowledge about parts of the body, but what do these mean? There are many examples of ways to decipher these words of knowledge, but my favorite (proven over and over) is through the full armor of God. It looks like this: #soul #spirit #darkness #holy-spirit #invitation #revelation #prayer 


|Body Part     | Armor | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Head, neck |  Helmet of Salvation   | Belief (doubt) |
|Chest, back	|Breastplate of Righteousness |Sin, broken heart, betrayals
|Stomach, gut |Belt of Truth |Lies, deceit
|Legs, feet |Shoes of Peace |Division, condemnation, fear
|Dominate hand |Sword of Spirit |Attack on person’s calling
|Passive hand |Shield of Faith |Need baptism in the Holy Spirit

The “Meaning” column reflects examples of possible translations of the sin that was chosen by the person being delivered, and/or those that trespassed against them, and/or their forefathers. As with all things in Terraforming, do not use this column as a formula, but depend upon the Holy Spirit to reveal to you what the meaning is for each situation. God wants to see us set free! This is exactly what happens when we depend upon His Light to reveal the hidden sins in His timing, and then cast down the accuser with the Blood of the lamb and the word of our testimonies. #armor #holy-spirit #revelation #god #light #sin #blood #jesus 

### Fear and Anger

After dealing with defilement, we move on to heart wounds. The signatures of heart wounds are almost always fear and anger. These two frequently walk together. When a person’s heart is broken, they are in pain that is hard to describe. There is no medicine to take away the pain and suffering can take months, years, or even decades to heal. The most common sources of heart wounds are tied to all four defilements, but especially broken covenant. The short list of heart wound sources are as follows:

1. Trauma
2. Rejection
3. Abandonment
4. Betrayal
5. Neglect

As we’ve discussed before, satan tries to pin the ultimate blame of heart wounds on God to get us to accuse Him of one of these three sources. The result is that we are either afraid that God is not who He says He is, or we are angry at Him for what has happened to us. Once we’ve done this, we become the accuser and have allowed the kingdom of darkness to build the most powerful individual stronghold that can be made. If we have accused God, we must repent of this, receiving the Blood of the Lamb and speaking out the word of our testimony of freedom. Once we’ve hurled down the accuser, we must remember to remove all demons that have called rights to these sins, casting them to the feet of Jesus. This way the stronghold is shut down. #wound #heart #broken-covenant #accusation #kingdom #darkness #blood #jesus #demons #forgiveness #terraforming #splinter

### Residue

Demonic seeds ([[Matthew 13_24-29\|Matt 13:24-29]]) are excellent examples of trace materials left behind after demons are removed. These fingerprints of evil must be burned, blown, and washed away to #bible-verse

complete the cleansing of a person, place, or thing before entering the Presence of the Lord. By removing them, we also ensure that further intrusion by the kingdom of darkness will terminate. There are various techniques of extraction that depend upon the type of residue. Most can be removed through the all consuming fire of the Lord if we ask Him to come. #cleansed #kingdom-of-darkness 

The residue of heart wounds manifest as weapons of warfare. Rejection shows up on a person like arrows shot into their heart. As with most heart wounds, these can be generational, and the arrow creates a “shunt” in the heart that marks them as targets for continued rejection (victims). The shunt’s dual purpose is to act like a magnet for predators and to make shots into the heart easier for the next time they are rejected. Predators are humans that have committed repetitive sins of defilement. They become a host for a demonic spirit that adds power to their ability to lure. They are also uncontrollably attracted to victims with magnetic shunts in their hearts. #heart #wound #generation #rejection #rejected #sin #spirit #defilement 

The residue of abandonment and neglect shows up as a poisonous dart shot into the heart very similarly to the arrows of rejection. The shunt is not as open for further shots, but it does still act like a magnet for predators. Betrayal is reflected by a butchers knife in the back. With witchcraft involved, these blades can be twisted, crooked, or curved at the ends. It is extremely important that you take your time listening to the Holy Spirit about how the blade was altered so the specific sins can be forgiven and the blade straightened. Once this has happened, the blade will come out easily after the predator is forgiven and the accuser hurled down.  #abandoning #abandonment #heart #betrayal

One of the more powerful heart wounds is found in the victim of incest, especially where a parent is involved. I have seen few examples if any of parental incest where witchcraft was not involved either directly or through the generations, so it is safe to say that they are related. This combination is part of the strategy for altering the human DNA to the kingdom of the antichrist.

It is a modern example of [[Genesis 6_1-4\|Gen. 6:1-4]]. The signature of this violation is a fourth toe that is bent in the direction of the first, or “big toe.” In modern medical terms, the fourth digit or “p. nonvoratus” (piggy that had none) bent or curved at the middle phalanx in the direction of the first digit “p. fori” (piggy that went to market). I have literally prayed for hundreds of people with this signature where both incest and witchcraft were in the family. Once the predators were forgiven, the accuser hurled down, and the strongholds dismantled, the person’s life changed dramatically. #bible-verse #witchcraft #holy-spirit #rejection #generation #generational-sins #forgiveness #dismantle 

### Memory

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.”  [[Psalm 34_16\|Psalm 34:16]]* #bible-verse

The human mind remembers trespasses that were against us both directly and through the generations. Equally, the human body does as well. This is certainly true at the microscopic, DNA level where generational sins are passed down physically ([[Numbers 14_18\|Num. 14:18]]). This memory must be removed and / or neutralized before the demolition is complete. We pray healing for this affliction as a request of the Lord and a proclamation on the earth. The Father has already lead us to set the person free through forgiveness. #bible-verse  #generational-sins 

The highlighted signatures have been resolved. The final step is to clear all residue, and memory is the last major one of these. So unless you get a check in your spirit, declare the healing of all pain in mental memories, all habits, reflexes, and instincts of personality that have developed, and the restoration of the DNA of the person’s body as a part of the testimony of the forgiveness with the Blood of Jesus. At this point, the stronghold is fully dismantled.  #memory #generation #healing  #forgiveness

### Language

Profanity is an amazing paradox. Here you have simple words, combinations of letters with phonetic phrasing. Somehow these create a horrible sensation of pain for many listeners. But why? Why are we so offended by these simple, english alphabet sequences spoken by human information transmitters? Is it the meaning of the words? Are subject matters such as procreation and human waste forbidden topics in scripture? Clearly there is more to these words than just the particulars of language.  #language 

We see that language can be empowered with spiritual seeds that magnify the impact of their meaning. This goes beyond mere translation, these words are spiritually pregnant. A picture of this #spiritually-pregnant

can be found with fruit. When a mammal eats fruit from a tree, they ingest seeds with this fruit. When the mammal then defecates later, the seeds are passed and left on the ground with natural fertilizer. This was God’s process of multiplying fruit trees across the earth. As mammals travel distances between trees, the seeds are passed among an ever growing geographical area. #seed 

Over the years, some words have been impregnated with seeds of love and others with seeds of evil. When these are spoken by humans who have been created in the image of God with the power of life and death in their tongues, powerful events are set into motion. The atmosphere is seeded with either love or not love (good or evil). Adult sons and daughters of God are called to seed the atmosphere with life giving words, with testimonies of the goodness of God. These literally impart the gospel of Jesus Christ on earth. #seed #sons-and-daughters 

Royal Priests are called to clean up the atmosphere of the seeds of evil that fill the earth. We therefore forgive the people whose words have polluted the environment. By hurling down the accuser and stripping evil of its rights to use this against us, we capture significant ground for the Kingdom of God. Over time, these words can be redeemed to their original purpose. In the meantime, we can take away from the kingdom of darkness the power that makes these words painful to listen to, and harmful when the seeds germinate, take root, and produce fruit of evil.  #love #evil #god #testimony #root #fruit

### Dismantling a Hardened Heart

The first step in our prayers for a person with a hardened heart is to remove the work of the enemy in their lives. The Lord will usually choose someone with the greatest authority in their lives to lead the prayer such as a spouse, child, or other that they are in covenant with. The chosen person along with others will call in the Light of Jesus to reveal the hidden sins that the enemy is using as legal rights to maintain the strongholds of deception. The chosen person will then forgive them of these sins, hurling down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. They will dismantle the power of the sins and thank the Lord for remembering their sins no more. #prayer #heart #authority #sin #legal-right #dismantle #forgiveness 

They will ask the Lord to heal them of all wounds and the pain associated with them. They will ask Him to heal the person of all habits, reflexes, and instincts that have been learned over the years of deception. They will proclaim the strongholds destroyed and cast all demons who have lost their rights to the feet of Jesus. We outlaw deception in the life of this person. This process can be repeated for the person’s home, work, church, and all material objects in their lives.  #demon #legal-right #healing #wound 

Finally, we ask the Lord to intervene in their lives. We ask Him to enter the “crack in the door” we have made through love and forgiveness and to invade the person’s dreams, shower time, and work with revelation. We ask Him to make all sin bitter in their lives and all righteousness sweet. We pray for mercy and grace while this person is healing. We ask Him to bring people into their life that reinforce Christ and reject sin. We ask the Lord for victory!#adult-season  #forgiveness #revelation #love #grace #healing #testimony
