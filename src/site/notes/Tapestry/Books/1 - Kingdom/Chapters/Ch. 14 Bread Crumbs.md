## Chapter 14: Bread Crumbs

>*“It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;* *to search out a matter is the glory of kings.” [[Proverbs 25_2\|Proverbs 25:2]]*   #bible-verse 

In the summer of 2006, the Lord began stretching Shari and me greatly. We had both grown up with Christian values that were based upon love and focused upon sanctification through repentance (a very good thing). Yet the Lord was taking us to a place deeper within His heart. This place was outside of our understanding of how God moved. As such we were very concerned that the supernatural events occurring around us were not God and could be an attempt of the enemy to get us to stray from the Truth.  #heart-of-God #supernatural #truth #trust #His-will #journey 

We attended a conference that July where a significant amount of gold was appearing out of nowhere. Not seeing the point of this within our belief system (no one was repenting), we were ready to walk out when the Lord said to us both, “*Trust Me*.” We did not know the person speaking who was calling for this gold to appear, but we did know the Lord. When we agreed to trust Him, it made room for Him to show us something we had never seen before. And that is exactly what happened. From that day forward the Lord was free to do anything He wanted in our lives. We trusted Him with all that we were. #trust #His-will

One way that the Lord speaks to us is with tiny individual events that could easily be dismissed as “insignificant life” or coincidence. The time on a clock, the weather, the word or statement of a total stranger, a fleeting thought, a gift, or even your own birthday are all examples. But when you have opened yourself to the Lord and allow Him to do what He wants to in your life, these things begin to connect as language. We call these “Bread Crumbs.” They are tiny events left on the path in front of you by a loving Father who is directing you deeper into His heart. Follow the Bread Crumbs and you’ll know Him with an ever growing level of intimacy. Pick up the Bread Crumbs and you’ll notice that they are shaped like jigsaw puzzle pieces. Place each one on the table and wait. One day you’ll get another one that fits it perfectly. Over time they begin to form a picture. The Lord is speaking to you! He is revealing to you more and more of who He is and who you are! What an adventure it is to be walking with the Lord! He has much to say to us. The adventure begins when we choose to listen.  #invitation #His-will #bread-crumb #heart-of-God #adventure #listen 

### HEBREW

When opening your eyes to Bread Crumbs left by the Lord, it is extremely helpful to understand a few things about the language of Hebrew. First of all, be advised that Hebrew does not translate into English directly, but must be transliterated. This is primarily due to the fact that each Hebrew letter has multiple meanings while an English (Latin) letter has only a corresponding sound. Hebrew letters can be understood using either rabbinic (traditional) or Kabbalah (mystical) methods, the latter of which is not something I am promoting in this writing. But I believe that it is very important for Christians to understand the language that Jesus spoke and studied throughout His life and how it differs from our own language.

For example, the Hebrew letter for “D” (pronounced *[[dalet\|dalet]]*) and represented as d also has the pictorial meaning of a gate or door, and can represent poverty or neediness. There are no numbers in Hebrew, so letters each have a corresponding number. The numeric value of “D” is four (4). Now imagine a five letter word with each letter having at least three potential meanings and a numeric value. One word could be translated 15 different ways. The good news is that most words have common meanings so a sentence can be understood with confidence. The revelation for the English speaking world is that the language is truly very rich and has much to offer us in understanding our Lord and Savior. #hebrew/word #dalet #gate #door #bread-crumb 


### FOUR SEVEN

Larry Palmer and I went on a trip in June (2009) to Colorado as directed by the Lord. We had no idea why we were going, and were given less than 24 hours advance notice before leaving. On our first day there I took a digital picture of Larry in front of a massive outcropping of rocks on the land where our former house is. I noticed on my camera that it was picture #147 and that the time I took it was 10:47 am. I told Larry this and he said, “Wow. You took the 147th picture of a man born in 1947 at 10:47 am.” The brand of pants I was wearing that day was “Element 47.” We then continued on our day for a few hours, sang a few songs, and then headed back to the town where our hotel was for dinner. In the car I noticed that the temperature outside was 47 degrees. When we got to the hotel there was a building next door that housed the corporate headquarters of a radio station, “104.7 FM.” The Lord had our undivided attention...

>*"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail, which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?” [[Job 38_22-23\|Job 38:22-23]]* #bible-verse 

The first song we sang up on the mountain was called “Hail.” My son and I wrote it in April (2009). The words are a quotation of [[Job 38_22\|Job 38:22]]. We pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant next to our hotel and there in the grass was freshly fallen hail. After dinner we had an email from one of our intercessors in the Oklahoma City area.   She told us to look at Psalm 147, #bible-verse

especially verse 17. The scripture is cross-referenced to [[Job 38_22\|Job 38:22]]. #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can withstand his icy blast?” [[Psalm 147_17\|Psalm 147:17]]* #bible-verse 

There are times when the Lord puts pieces together in such a way that it “blows our minds.” We literally had no idea why we went to Colorado, but so many things were falling into place and so quickly. Sometimes this happens so fast, you don’t have time to chronicle all that He is doing. But we know it is Him and we get to trust Him to complete the picture being drawn by the joining of the jigsaw puzzle pieces in His timing. So we rested in what He was doing and watched as the pieces came together.

>*“I will give you the treasures of darkness, riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the LORD, the God of Israel, who summons you by name.” [[Isaiah 45_3\|Isaiah 45:3]]* #bible-verse 

Back when we were in New Orleans (April 2009), one of our Tulsa based intercessors received revelation from the Lord about our accessing the storehouses mentioned in Job 38. Those that were buried by the Lord under snow and hail for times of war and battle. The scripture she received was [[Isaiah 45_3\|Isa. 45:3]]. #bible-verse 

In Hebrew the number seven (7) corresponds to the letter “Z” (pronounced *zayin*). The pictorial representation is that of a sword while the number itself means wholeness or completeness. We therefore saw the numbers four and seven as being the wholeness of a gate or a completed door. From the standpoint of land, this spoke to us regarding the cleansing of the gates into a city or nation. We certainly saw this on our trip to New Orleans.  #hebrew/word #zayin #wholeness #completion #gate #door

The Father sent Jesus to be the gate through which all come to be saved. Jesus then sent us ([[John 20_21\|John 20:21]]) to be the gates through which His salvation is carried across the world. From the standpoint of people, four seven (4 & 7 or zayin & dalet) represents to us the hidden treasure we were obtaining in the spirit there in Colorado. It is God’s hidden strategy for bringing His children into wholeness. #bible-verse #hebrew/word #treasure #wholeness #discernment #spirit 

He showed us how the evil one has an ancient plan to keep the human race from ever reaching the fullness of our destiny to prevent the wedding from taking place. The enemy wants to keep the Bride from being available for marriage because she is either too young, deceived into rejecting the proposal, or dead. We received the Key to dismantle this plan while on the mountain. Element 47 (the brand of my pants) is silver, which is the last impurity that comes out of gold when it is heated. The Lord has given us the final piece to remove all impurities from our being. He wants us to be fully pure so we can see the fullness of Christ manifest in our lives! This strategy is released throughout the next few chapters. Read on! #wedding #purification #deception #evil-one #rejection #dismantle #puzzle-piece

### SNOWFLAKES IN A BLIZZARD

> [!quote]+ 
>*“No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him” [[1 Corinthians 2_9\|1 Corinthians 2:9]]* #bible-verse 

The ability to hear God’s voice and to discern His signs is a critical skill in moving into our destiny. Yet this basic requirement is only the beginning. From here, the Lord wants to train us in handling a stream of revelations from the Throne Room (downloads) and keeping these in mind when doing His work. This boot camp stretches us until we can hear His instructions on the fly and respond without hesitation. The biggest challenge is the sheer volume of input coming from Heaven. Our spirits are ready to go, but our souls and bodies cry out, “slow down Daddy, slow down!!!” #listen #discernment #revelation

When we reach the end of our training, our capacity to operate in the Lord’s timing is staggering. Each download is unique and precious like a snowflake. Each assignment is like a blizzard. There are many revelations, much to see, and much to do. We operate in teams, representing the unified body of Christ. Yet with all of these variables, we are always in the right place at the right time. He designed each of us and then prepared us to work in this environment. With His anointing on us, we perform superhuman tasks. It should be impossible, but the burden is light. #bride #revelation #light #church 

When people ask us to describe what the Lord does when we go out on assignment with Him, it is very difficult to do. Most of our trips have been over five days long with each day consisting of 20 hours of nonstop missions. We minister to people, dismantle ancient strongholds of evil in the land, teach at a conference, and sometimes lead worship to boot! We administrate last minute travel arrangements by foot, car, plane, or boat. We witness signs in the earth and sky, in the words of people we meet, and through the names of persons, places, and things. Sometimes we even get to eat! #assignment #adventure #rescue 

All of this happens in one day. Over multiple days, it can be a challenge to chronicle what happened. For this reason, when people ask “what happened when you were gone,” we respond with a sampling and say, “That is just one snowflake in a blizzard.” It is the life of an adult son or daughter of God. Those who are called are created to operate at a superhuman level. This book is written to and for those who have said, “yes” to God and are ready to lay down their lives for His higher calling. It costs you everything, but it sure is worth it. #missions #sons-and-daughters
