## Chapter 19: Restoring Land

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of truth; he who takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes.” [[Isaiah 65_16\|Isaiah 65:16]]* #bible-verse 

Creation is so much bigger than just us humans. The Lord created the heavens and the earth. He created light, time, atmosphere, gathered water (sea), dry ground (land), vegetation (plants and trees), the sun, the moon, the stars, and living creatures (in the waters, in the sky, and on the land). All of these things He called very good. Man was commissioned to subdue the earth and to rule over the living creatures.

> [!quote]+ 
>*“In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.” [[Genesis 2_9c\|Genesis 2:9c]]*  #bible-verse 

The Lord placed two trees in the center of the garden. These represented the choice of destinies for creation. One represented the destiny of dependency on God for everything. The other introduced the tainting that lucifer had brought to creation through the choice of self glorification and independence. So then, when the sin of disobedience was committed, Adam and Eve would know the pain of self reliance: toiling the ground for work and painful childbirth.

The root of all sin is self directed. The evil one, lucifer, wanted the glory of God to be self directed. Once Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the human race was married to its ruler: satan. We have taken on his characteristics for too long: liars, thieves, accusers, and destroyers. Why would we do these things? To protect and glorify ME. The self is the focus of all sin. It is 100% contrary to the definition of Love, which is unconditionally focused towards our Lover, not our self. #self-sourcing #selfish #satan

When sin entered the land outside of Eden at the hands of Cain, defilement was introduced. This is multiplied many times over as billions of people have populated the earth since creation (by some estimates over 100 billions births). Figuring that each human may sin many, many times in their life, the number of potential land defiling sins committed is staggering. The job of cleaning this up seems monumental, but all things are possible with God. Now our job is to clean and then speak forth blessings in the land, calling out the fullness of the destiny of all of creation! #root #sin #evil-one #creation #fullness #love #relationship 

### Defilement

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Men will be regularly employed to cleanse the land. Some will go throughout the land and, in addition to them, others will bury those that remain on the ground. At the end of the seven months they will begin their search. As they go through the land and one of them sees a human bone, he will set up a marker beside it until the gravediggers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Gog. And so they will cleanse the land.” [[Ezekiel 39_14-16\|Ezekiel 39:14-16]]* #bible-verse

Land does not sin. People do. As such, when land is defiled, we do not respond by washing the land with the Blood of Jesus. We love and fully forgive those who sinned by washing their feet with the Blood of Jesus and speaking out the word of their testimony of what the Blood has done for them. They are purified of all unrighteousness. They are redeemed of every consequence. They are restored to a right relationship with God. The accuser is hurled down and the memory of these sins is erased from all matter on earth (people, places, things). Then the land is cleansed.  #sin #blood #jesus #testimony #restored #purified #relationship #accuser

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The LORD said, ‘What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground. Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.’” [[Genesis 4_10-12\|Genesis 4:10-12]]* #bible-verse

Blood shed is the first defilement of land. This can relate to the murder of innocent men or women of God ([[Lamentations 4_14\|Lam. 4:14]]) or even the corpses of the enemies of the Lord (Ezekiel 39). This can included aborted babies, torture of the innocents, practices of cutting, and other witchcraft rituals that involve the shedding of blood (sacrifices). All of these people must be fully forgiven for the land to be free of its memory of this blood. #bible-verse #defilement #bloodshed #memory 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant.” [[Isaiah 24_5\|Isaiah 24:5]]* #bible-verse

Broken covenant is the second defilement of land. These covenants can be with the Lord or with other persons. Saul broke covenant with the Gibeonites and stained his house with blood when he swore to spare them and then later tried to annihilate them ([[2 Samuel 21_1-2\|2 Sam. 21:1-2]]) resulting in a famine that lasted three years. Also, swindling (stealing from those that trust you), going against your word, and false pretense (lying to build trust) are examples. #bible-verse #broken-covenant 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.” [[Jeremiah 16_18\|Jeremiah 16:18]]* #bible-verse

Idolatry is the third defilement of the land. Since the resurrection of Jesus, when people who have chosen Him as their savior and bow to the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and King David then bow to another god, they are polluting that which is Holy. All witchcraft and occult based activities are idolatry with demons. All pagan religions are idolatry with demons in disguise. All esoteric societies that introduce ancient rituals and rites from non-Hebrew lands are idolatrous. #sacrifices #witchcraft #trust #defilement #jesus #demons #idolatry

>*“But you must keep My decrees and My laws. The native-born and the aliens living among you must not do any of these detestable things *[sexual immorality]*, for all these things were done by the people who lived in the land before you, and the land became defiled. And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you.”* [[Leviticus 18_26-28\|Lev. 18:26-28]]* #bible-verse 

Sexual immorality is the fourth and last defilement. In Leviticus 18, many sins are listed including sex with close relatives, women during menstruation, same-gender relations, and bestiality. Adultery is a combination of sexual immorality (fornication) and broken covenant (betrothal covenant). We are to love and forgive our brethren when they commit these sins as the Father has loved and forgiven us. Do not judge any person, but always walk in the knowledge of our own susceptibility to sin ourselves. #bethrothal-covenant  #broken-covenant #forgiveness 

Underneath all defilements is the work of the enemy to get humans to enter into evil covenants. Lucifer wants the bride to enter into an evil betrothal covenant not for Love, but to use and discard her when her value is gone. When a person willfully enters into this covenant, or is entered in as a result of the generational sin of their forefathers, they can be recognized by the characteristics they have in common with their groom: liars ([[John 8_44\|John 8:44]]), accusers ([[Revelation 12_10-12\|Rev. 12:10 - 12]]), thieves and destroyers ([[John 10_10\|John 10:10]]). Not everyone who lies or steals is in marital covenant with satan, but those who are will be powerfully bound to the sins. Dissolve these covenants and dismantle the sins and defilements as a Royal Priest and set all of creation free! This is where the fun begins. #bible-verse #bethrothal-covenant  #love #forgive #covenants #satan #church #bride #not-love #choice #love #generational-sins #marriage #royal-priest #creation #freedom #dismantle 

### Bundling

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people. One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their king will pass through before them, the LORD at their head.”  [[Micah 2_12-13\|Micah 2:12-13]]* #bible-verse

With billions of people that have lived on the earth since creation, it is reasonable to guess that there may be trillions of sins that have occurred and defiled the land. The Lord knows this and also the number of His children on earth that will be called to cleanse the land. As such, He has blessed us with the ability to bundle when necessary. First we ask Him to shine the Light of His Presence to reveal the hidden sins (what) and the specific sinner (who). In many cases, He will reveal to us that information with great clarity.

In other cases He may be silent. We may not have to declare the specific sin or the specific sinner. Instead the Lord has us say, “*I forgive every person *(who) *for every time they fell short of the glory of God *(what). *I sprinkle them with the Blood of Jesus and they are purified and redeemed*.” In this way the person, place, or thing is blanketed in forgiveness and the accuser is hurled down.

### Riches

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I will give you the treasures of darkness, riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the LORD, the God of Israel, who summons you by name.” [[Isaiah 45_3\|Isaiah 45:3]]*  #bible-verse

In Colorado, Larry and I found blessings that the Lord had stored in the land. To be honest, we had been looking for gold coins. Every prophetic word pointed to gold being found in the land, which was confirmed with scriptures emphasizing riches and storehouses ([[Job 38_22\|Job 38:22]]) which are buried under snow and hail. We did not find gold coins in the natural. What we found was of far greater value. We found spiritual keys that unlock the fullness of our calling. We found that which would bring us to perfection and thus the fullness of authority that God wanted to impart.  #bible-verse #storehouse #spiritual-key #fullness #authority 

*“Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. So he said to them, ‘Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people. If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man*

>*sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?’ His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death.” [[1 Samuel 2_22-25\|1 Samuel 2:22-25]]*  #bible-verse

The Lord has been speaking to us about the sons of Eli for sometime now. He has shown us the importance of Eli’s priesthood and Saul’s royal house in comparison to the royal house of David and the priesthood of Zadok. Saul did not have an intimate relationship with God. Because of this, he had to turn to Samuel for direction. David did have a direct relationship with the Lord and was a man after His own heart. Equally, Zadok was loyal to the Lord’s will as manifested in his loyalty to the royal house of David (Solomon’s election for the throne). Eli was disloyal to the Lord as demonstrated in his failure to move the behavior of his sons through discipline. He rebuked them, but failed in discipline. #priest 

It was in Colorado that we found a rich spiritual river of the anointing and impartation of returning justice and discipline to the Body of Christ, especially in the United States. Before we left He had downloaded the revelation about the soul being splintered, the need for the valves to be fully opened, and the danger of the soul leading the being of a person when it is the spirit that receives from the Lord where it is seated in Heavenly places. We knew that there were issues of behavior that needed to be dealt with, but the pieces had not come together fully yet. #soul #splinter #spirit 

As soon as we got to Colorado, the picture came to form. We got the 4 7 revelation (perfection / completeness of the gates), we saw the hail that pictured the storehouses the Lord had buried there. He tied all the loose ends on our third day there in a vision as I woke up. He showed me how justice and discipline are meant to avoid judgement. They are tools that the Lord has given us to take us the rest of the way beyond defeating the evil one. They help us defeat ourselves: our own freewill that can make or break us in reaching the fullness of our destiny. #intimacy #relationship #church #spirit #evil-one #freewill #fullness #storehouse #gate 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, ‘This is what the LORD says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?*

>*Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: ‘I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before Me forever.’ But now the LORD declares: ‘Far be it from Me! Those who honor Me I will honor, but those who despise Me will be disdained. I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in My heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before My anointed one always.’” [[1 Samuel 2_27,29b-30,35\|1 Samuel 2:27,29b-30,35]]*  #bible-verse

The headlines of the Denver Post that day read, “Out of Hiding, Seeking Justice.” My full name is Scott Justice Norvell (named after my mother’s grandfather, Scott Justice). The name Scott has the spiritual connotation of “Temple.” My name literally means, Temple Justice, or the justice and discipline that Eli never brought to his sons, costing them the priesthood. The priesthood was passed to Zadok and his sons. On April 1, 2008 the Lord called me a Priest in the order of Zadok and confirmed in June 2008 that I would train the sons of Zadok for the end times. All of this was brought into focus in June 2009 as the vision of the Lord came to me in Colorado. #priest 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.” [[Hebrews 12_7b,8,11\|Hebrews 12:7b,8,11]]*  #bible-verse

Terraforming was given by God to the Body of Christ to be a handbook for the royal priests in the end times. It is important beyond measure that we understand how the priesthood was taken from the house of Eli and why. We must know that the willful choices of his sons to fall short of the Glory of God were contemptuous and could not be overlooked ([[1 Samuel 2_17\|1 Sam. 2:17]]). We must understand that even with the complete dismantling of the kingdom of darkness, we are back to square one as Adam was: we still have to choose Love over not-Love. The Lord will not make our choice for us. We must choose what is right. If our behavior conflicts with this, we are accountable to address this with God for his grace and mercy, and to submit to the provision of justice and discipline so this behavior will change.  #bible-verse #terraforming #church #royal-priest  #dismantle #kingdom-of-darkness  #love #not-love #choice #grace #provision

### Blessings

> [!quote]+ 
>*“He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.”* [[Proverbs 28_19\|Proverbs 28:19]]* #bible-verse 

The destiny of the Roman empire was to mature into adulthood, receive the fullness of the authority the Lord wanted to delegate, and then bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world. Instead, the gospel of Jesus Christ became a religion (christianity), was combined with pagan practices, and the church was rendered impotent. After this the Lord gave Rome many chances for redemption, even after its decline. In the 800’s AD Charlemagne (my 41st-great grandfather) placed Jesus Christ at the head of the Holy Roman Empire, but failed at imparting His Love. Instead, conversions were forced upon people and nations, bringing resentment and loss where there should have been freedom and gain. #destiny #mature #fullness #authority 

The enemy wants to pollute the blessings in the land so they cannot be used by the royal priests to bring the Bride into her fullness. Additionally, satan wants to use the blessings for perverted purposes that strengthens the power of the kingdom of darkness to continue its practices and prevent judgement from ever happening. To this end, all deception, temptation, accusation, theft and destruction that occurs in dark places is meant for this purpose: keeping creation from its destiny. Like Rome, the destiny of the United States is to mature into adulthood, receive the authority, and bring the gospel to the world. Evil is working hard to keep this from happening. #royal-priest #fullness #destiny 

All land has destiny sown into it by its creator, our Father in Heaven. In the town I live in, Tulsa, Oklahoma, one example of that blessing is the anointing for worship. The Lord wants to raise up powerful worship in His people as a fruit of being God- reliant. The enemy wants to pervert this through the sin of idolatry, specifically through the worship of mankind.

The two biggest selling country artists of all time are from the Tulsa area and have been massively successful outside of the genre. Neither sing for evil purposes. Yet the perversion of the evil one has caused audiences to respond to this blessing with sin (idolatry of man). Being a “star” is the ambitions of many people of this generation. At the root of stardom is self-glory, which is sin. #worship #covenant #condition #idolatry #sin #root 

In Colorado, the blessing was justice and discipline to get the Body of Christ ready for her Groom. Yet the evil one has polluted discipline by influencing a society based upon self gain. Only those infractions that cause chaos are punished, not those that are contrary to Love. Therefore it is unlawful to murder (root of chaos) yet lawful and encouraged to be greedy as long as you follow the generally accepted practices of wealth accumulation. The discipline of adults is also viewed very negatively by modern society, which is far too prideful (self importance) to be humbled voluntarily. The enemy has also influenced psycho-perversion and sexual immorality (self- pleasure) as distractions from God’s original design for discipline. #heart #god #fruit #good-and-evil #evil-one #root #sin #church #love #groom #self-sourcing #temptation 

In Virginia, the blessing sown by God was fruitfulness. This multiplying effect would have the benefit of distributing the gospel of Jesus Christ through the early settlers quickly and efficiently. What grew was tobacco, which was then cured and smoked in peace ceremonies by the Native American tribes. The evil one then came with the temptation of lust (self pleasure), murder (self positioning), and broken covenant (self advancement at the expense of others). Now the fruit of tobacco is lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death among men in the western hemisphere. #self-sourcing #self-seeking 

The opportunity in front of us for the Body of Christ is to dismantle evil in the lives of all people, all places, and all things in creation. We can then enter the storehouses of provision, the riches that God has hidden in the land for such a time as this. When individual groups of people walk in this destiny, they will affect their region. When other groups in the surrounding area do the same, their region is affected until the inflating boundaries of impact bump into each other and entire nations are restored. And from nations, the world. #jesus #broken-covenant #evil-one #temptation #fruit #church #storehouse #provision #dismantle #discernment

### Honor

There once was a man in prison. He was guilty of his crime and readily admitted this. For him, days were spent in regret as he remembered his childhood, dreaming of being an astronaut when he grew up. Instead he was locked in a cell where the memories of childhood seemed distant, his hopes seemed shattered. One day, the jailer came and unlocked his cell. He was led to a room in the prison where he was told that the leader of their nation had granted him a full pardon. #memory #allegory 

He was free! This concept alone was beyond his reckoning. As they allowed him to change clothes and then led him to the exit, his mind raced with possibilities. He simply could not believe that his life of captivity, alone in a cell with no rights, no freedom, and withered dreams was over. When they opened the last doors to the prison and the bright light shone on his face, he was surprised to see that a limousine was waiting to take him the rest of the way.  #seed #allegory #light #allegory 

Inside the limo was the leader of their nation himself! He had come to give the freedman a very specific message. “*We have identified you with a unique skill set. Because of this, you are being sent to astronaut training at an undisclosed location*.” The man could not believe his ears. He had been set free from prison. His offenses had been pardoned. His rights had been fully restored to him and life could begin again. This alone was enough for him to be grateful for the rest of his life. Now they want to make his dreams a reality by making him an astronaut? #grace #freedom #fullness #allegory 

The man tried to explain all of these emotions to the leader. He almost changed the subject, as the prospect of his life changing from negative 80 to positive 20 and now to positive 100 in just a few minutes, was beyond his comprehension. The leader interrupted him, “*I wasn’t finished. We are also honoring you. You will be the first human being to land and set foot on the planet Mars*.” The man was speechless. How is it possible for a person to go from captivity to freedom, to then having your longings fulfilled? And then from longing fulfilled to being honored in such a way? Was he dreaming? #allegory

As with all things in the Lord, freedom from captivity is only the beginning of the story. Next comes testing (training) and then the promised land (blessed and honored). The Israelites saw this same process as they were freed from Egypt. This is true of all creation. God has designed us with purpose that is beyond our wildest dreams. The evil one has corrupted creation with lies told in the dark. When people, the rulers of creation, come into agreement with these lies, creation is held in captivity. If instead, we walk in the Light, we can set creation free with the Blood. If we will then submit to His Authority, He will work all of the kinks out. Then we can fulfill our purpose of leading creation to its destiny! #freedom #forgiveness  #purpose  #destiny #invitation  #allegory
