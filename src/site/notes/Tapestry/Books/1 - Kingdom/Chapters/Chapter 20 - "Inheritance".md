## Chapter 20: Inheritance

> [!quote]+ 
>*“'I am to be the only inheritance the priests have. You are to give them no possession in Israel; I will be their possession.”* *[[Ezekiel 44_28\|Ezekiel 44:28]]* #bible-verse 

As sons and daughters of God, we have been given an inheritance from our Lord. Our Father planned who we would be, what we would be called to do, and what people, places, and things we would interact with throughout our lives. He did not plan our choices, these He fore-knew. Yet when we say “yes” to the call of God, the Lord releases this inheritance to us. We begin to walk in the amazing life that He intended for us! And what is this inheritance? It is Him. In His Presence all things fall into place. #sons-and-daughters #inheritance #father 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Who may ascend into the hill of the LORD? Or who may stand in His holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to an idol, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is Jacob, the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face. Lift up your heads, O you gates! And be lifted up, you everlasting doors! And the King of glory shall come in.” [[Psalm 24_3-7\|Psalm 24:3-7]]* #bible-verse

The Light of Jesus has revealed all impurities that must be dealt with. Through forgiveness, these impurities are washed away with the Blood of Jesus and the word of our testimony. All enemy agents have been detached and removed from their strongholds. The angels of God are now in place. This person, this place, this thing are now clean. Who may stand in the Presence of God? Only he who is clean and pure can. We are now ready for the Presence of the Lord. We are ready for the King of Glory to come in.

> [!quote]+ 
>*“When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart.” [[Matthew 13_19a\|Matthew 13:19a]]* #bible-verse

In the Parable of the Sower we learn that seeds of the kingdom are sown in our hearts. These seeds are foundational pieces of the destiny we are called to in Christ, intended to produce fruit for the Kingdom that has eternal ramifications. These can be stolen from us by the enemy through our belief in his lies, through our faltering when persecuted, or through our worldly (non-kingdom) intentions for God’s promises.

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Yet if [a thief] is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house.” [[Proverbs 6_31\|Proverbs 6:31]]* #bible-verse

When the Light of Jesus reveals the Truth to us and we reconcile to God through the precious Blood, we see these seeds fully restored to us by demanding that the thief return what he stole. We can then ask the Holy Spirit to re-sow these back into our hearts where they belong. If they are kingdom promises, we need them and should fight for them. When the seeds are sown in good soil, we will produce fruit in some cases a hundredfold what was planted. #truth #seed #holy-spirit 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people.”  [[Zechariah 8_12\|Zechariah 8:12]]* #bible-verse

Many people who have been deceived by the lies of the evil one look back after many years with deep sorrow feeling that their life was stolen from them. They believe that the hopes and dreams from their youth are gone for good and cannot be returned to them. Many feel like Job did right around chapter 3 – they have lost property, children, a spouse, their health, or their calling in God. They believe that their life has been lost forever. But through the restoration power of the Blood of Jesus, this is not so! Our lives are a net gain! Whenever the Truth is believed in place of the lie, the Blood is the power that takes us to Job chapter 42: full restoration of what was stolen—with restitution!  #revelation #restoration  #holy-spirit #heart #evil-one #fullness

>*“The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. “ [[Job 42_12a\|Job 42:12a]]* #bible-verse


### Calling

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.” [[Philippians 3_12b\|Philippians 3:12b]]* #bible-verse 

Early in 2005, the Lord moved Shari and me to Tulsa, Oklahoma from our mountain fortress (cabin) in Colorado. It was here that the Lord connected me with the blessings of the land in Tulsa, combined with my personal calling in the Lord and with all of the seeds of life that He had sown in my heart through my spiritual mentors on earth. From this change in our circumstances came some early fruit of the gifts God had given me. But none would compare with what happened when we abandoned all to follow Him.

Late in 2006 I learned that my childhood best friend had died of a drug overdose. This news impacted my being with great force and I wept loudly in Shari’s arms for hours. Standing on my relationship with God, I kept crying out to Him for intervention for my friend. Fearing for the eternal implications of his death, I called out, “Lord! He was my brother!” The Lord answered back instantaneously through Shari, “They are ALL your brothers.” This rocked me to the core. I realized that the Lord was revealing to me His heart when people die not receiving the free gift of salvation through believing in Jesus. After this, nothing would be the same. #revelation

By January of 2007 the Lord had shown me that He had a great call on our lives and to fulfill this, there was further change needed in our lives. I needed to quit my job. Now this may sound simple, but for me it was nowhere near that. We have five children and Shari stays at home, so how would we live? The Lord said, “Trust Me.” I had heard this before, and as always, He was right. Over time, I came to realize that it was God calling me to quit. And if He called me to it, I knew it was the right thing to do. #calling #seed #heart #fruit #gifts #revelation #heart-of-God #salvation #jesus #trust 

### Yes, However...

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.” [[Hebrews 4_16\|Hebrews 4:16]]* #bible-verse

That being said, I knew that I was unable to quit my job. It was quite a dilemma. On one hand I knew that the Lord was calling me to quit. I had to say “yes.” On the other, I knew that I was not capable of walking out that “yes,” despite the fact that it was what I wanted more than anything. These are the times in life when we must be honest with God. Tell Him the truth! I know this may come as a surprise to some, but the Lord actually wants to hear us admit when we need help. God is not judging us on how we earn His love, He is watching to see if we CHOOSE Him or not. In this case, I was able to choose Him by simply acknowledging my inability to accept His invitation to quit. #journey #faith #trust 

I needed a savior. Praise God! When I admitted it, He responding with, “I’ve been waiting to hear you say that!” God is in the business of saving people. This was no surprise to Him. Over the course of the next few months, the Lord lovingly confirmed His word to me over and over again. As time went by, my heart changed. I realized that no matter what He called us to do, no matter how costly, it would be worth it. He would meet our every need!   #faith #trust #journey #His-will #provision #adventure #testimony

>*“Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision.” [[Psalm 144_13a\|Psalm 144:13a]]* #bible-verse 

On May 11, 2007 I quit my job as a Senior Vice President in banking and started our life in faith. Since that time the Lord has been faithful to meet our every need. It has not always looked the way I wanted it to, but it was according to His plan, and it was for our good. Everything exploded in our lives after that day. We have come to understand our gifts and calling in a far greater way than ever before. There are truly no words to express how our lives have changed. Since we gave God the reins in our lives, we are living the great adventure. #provision #trust #gift #adventure 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him” [[1 Corinthians 2_9\|1 Corinthians 2:9]]* #bible-verse 

I understand now that God created me with a plan in mind. He chose to assign to me a certain number of talents that would fit the life that He had designed for me. He hand picked the gifts of the Spirit that I would need to accomplish my mission. He aligned me with the people and placed me on the land that would support this mission with blessing and anointing to bring the revelation of this book to the world. That was my destiny. It has been available to me my whole life. I only had to accept the invitation and walk in it. #mission #spirit #gift #destiny #invitation #trust #journey #alignment 

What has the Lord planned for you? Does He have great responsibilities for you to walk out or lesser ones? Will you minister to those who are sick? Will you evangelize the lost? Will you lead a nation to the higher calling? Will you tell the Truth even if it gets you killed? For this call, you will need to lay everything on the altar. There is nothing that can be held back. It costs you everything. #invitation #heart-of-God #calling 

But it is worth it.

### Consecration

> [!quote]+ 
>*“So you shall put them on Aaron your brother and on his sons with him. You shall anoint them, consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to Me as priests.” [[Exodus 28_41\|Exodus 28:41]]* #bible-verse

Before welcoming the Presence of the Lord into the hearts of His people, we anoint them with oil. This is a statement of their being consecrated unto the Lord by the Blood of Jesus. Any oil can be used, although olive oil is our preferred choice. There is also oil you can buy for such purposes that has been prayed over and mixed with aromatic resins. A mere dab can be placed on the person’s hands and/or forehead or just about any other appropriate place with the person’s permission. Samuel did pour the oil over Saul and David’s heads, but that dramatic of a statement is usually not required for this purpose. #consecration #anointing 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“And the children of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, brought the tithe of oxen and sheep; also the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God they laid in heaps.” [[2 Chronicles 31_6\|2 Chronicles 31:6]]* #bible-verse

Places and things should also be anointed with oil. Many techniques have been developed by intercessors throughout the years for claiming a territory that are excellent and useful. These include anointing doors, windows, furniture, and even the boundary corners of a property (including larger territories such as cities or States). Cars, roads, bridges, and highway marker posts are all possible targets. Some have buried scripture verses written on paper, stakes, and rocks in the earth of a property. The list is endless, and all can be appropriate, as led by the Holy Spirit. #anointing #blood #jesus #consecration #intercessors #holy-spirit #authority 

### The Blessing of the Father

> [!quote]+ 
>*“And when David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.” [[2 Samuel 6_18\|2 Samuel 6:18]]* #bible-verse

> [!quote]+ 
>*“So I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the crawling locust, the consuming locust, and the chewing locust, My great army which I sent among you. You*

*shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you; and My people shall never be put to shame. Then you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: I am the LORD your God and there is no other. My people shall never be put to shame.” [[Joel 2_25-27\|Joel 2:25–27]]* #bible-verse

*“But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear; for assuredly, I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.”* *[[Matthew 13_16-17\|Matthew 13:16–17]]* #bible-verse 

### Worship

*“Heavenly Father, we praise Your Name. We come to You today with a heart of thanksgiving for this Kingdom Family that You have invited us into. It is such a privilege to be called your sons and daughters. There is nothing greater than the life You have given us both in our identity and the destiny You created us for. Your Light changes our condition radically from pain, sorrow, and grief to celebration.*

*Thank You for Jesus. Thank You for the King that loves us so much, He died that we might inherit life and to have it more abundantly. We are grateful for the gift of praising Your name in eternal glory for saving us through the atoning Blood of Jesus.*

*Thank You for the gift of Your Holy Spirit. We thank You Lord for the authority and the power to be set free and the commission to set others free. We thank You for the mandate to bring Your Will on earth as it is in heaven. We receive all that You are in our lives. We yield to Your endless Love, Wisdom, Mercy, and Grace. Yours is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory forever.”*

Amen. #prayer
