## Chapter 9: Deliverance

> [!quote]+ 
>*“But deliver us from the evil one...” [[Matthew 6_13b \|Matthew 6:13b]]*  #bible-verse

### CHARACTER

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Bold and arrogant, these men are not afraid to slander celestial beings; yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not bring slanderous accusations against such beings in the presence of the Lord.”  [[2 Peter 2_10-11a\| 2 Peter 2:10-11a]]* #bible-verse

Before we can deliver we must understand who we are and what we are empowered to do. We are a people of love. As such we speak with love and humility in all of our dealings. Understanding and walking in the upper hand that we’ve been given is important to our task, but it is imperative that we do not extend this to become arrogant in our warfare. Yelling at demons, mocking them, or cursing them is not needed to defeat them. In many cases you are only harming the person being delivered, and yourself. Always pray as if the Lord Himself were in the room with you: with fear and humility. Because after all, He is in the room with you!  #love #demons #pray #alignment #god #identity #destiny 

### HOOKS AND LOOPS

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet.” [[Habakkuk 1_15a\|Habakkuk 1:15a]]* #bible-verse

Hook and loop fasteners (such as Velcro™) are known for their strength in holding two pieces of fabric together. The first layer contains multiple, tiny “hooks” while the second, fuzzy layer has “loops” that the hooks fasten onto. Once joined it is nearly impossible to take them apart with equal pressure across the fabric. You must peel them apart starting at either end.

Similarly, demons are looking for loops on us that they can sink their hooks into. If our surface is smooth, they are out of luck. If we have the hoops in place, they will stick and not let go. The “loops” in us come from sin. When we sin, we grant demons the legal right to fasten onto us with their “hooks.” The attachment is very powerful. The best way to undo this is to cause the “loops” to fall off of you. We do this when we forgive with the Blood of Jesus and then speak out the word of our testimony. Suddenly, there is no place for the hooks to grab ahold of! #demon #forgiveness #blood-of-Jesus #power #legal-right #freedom 

Demons are motivated. They obtain their legal rights to manifest from our sin, therefore, our sinning is the source of their power. As you can imagine, they have great incentive to get us to fall to their temptation and they are fierce when defending their strongholds. This is why they start with the “sweetness” of sin, i.e., self gratification from power, influence, heroic status, or the pleasure of sexuality. It is with these carrots that the enemy lures us into sin. Once we sin, they come back with accusation, condemnation, and shame. All are ways to trap us into the sin, build their stronghold, and receive unending power throughout generations of a family to manifest their evil on the earth. It is a terrible crime. #demons #sin #legal-right #forgiveness #blood #jesus #temptation #accusation #deception #generational-sins #demonic-stronghold 

### ELECTRIC ONION

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” [[Ephesians 6_12\|Ephesians 6:12]]* #bible-verse 

Once a single demon has locked onto us, more try to join that demon to create strength in numbers. The resulting strongholds can best be described as “electric onions.” There is a nucleus, which is a tiny demon, but has the most authority in the hierarchy. Each layer that covers the nucleus is a larger demon

(in size), but with less authority. Eventually you get huge demons that have little authority. The power of the stronghold comes from the sins that are the legal rights for each demon to be present. This is true of all of the demons, the little demons with great authority, and the huge demons with less authority. Together, they are a tough nut to crack.   #demons #authority #legal-right 

Each demon on the outer layers are named after their manifestation in the person. A demon named anger will manifest as anger. A demon named defiance will manifest as defiance in the person, and so on. There are a significant number of possibilities, but the best way to identify them is to watch the behavior of the person and the Holy Spirit will give you the name. If the person yells, “I am going to kill you!!!” It is likely that the demon’s name is murder. #demon #anger #holy-spirit #light-of-jesus #discernment 

The reason you need to know the name of the demon is simply in case the manifestation of the demon is causing a disturbance that prevents the person from having access to their own freewill. They need this access because they must choose to be free or the deliverance is temporary. Sometimes we need a stable environment in which to Terraform, and so we simply cast the demons away from the person and then head straight for the roots. #demons #legal-right #sin #holy-spirit #choice #terraforming #root #foundation #layers 

In the past we started with the outer layer of demons. This was problematic because those outer layer demons are bullies and will fight you tooth and nail. They are also compulsive liars and will muddy the water considerably. It is in the nature of a demon to hide, especially from a seasoned Terraformer. In most cases you will not know the demons are there (by manifestation) unless you pull a trigger that lets them know they are in trouble. Then things can get messy. #terraforming #demon #holy-spirit #discernment 

It is always preferable to neutralize the nucleus first. This is literally like unplugging any appliance, the power is gone and it is severely weakened. To take out the nucleus, you must pray and ask the Holy Spirit to lead you to the root sin, i.e., that which brought about the rights of the central demon to afflict the person. In most cases, these roots are generational (sins, curses, and memories). In other cases, the person was involved with witchcraft directly and repentance is needed.  In rare cases, the

root sin is due to the person not forgiving a trespasser. While this will cause affliction to a person, it is rarely found at the root of a demonic stronghold. #layers #demons #terraformer #holy-spirit #repenting #root #foundation #forgiveness #legal-right #generational-sins #generational-forgiveness 

### RENDERING DEMONS HOMELESS

> [!quote]+ 
>*“When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none. Then he says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first.” [[Matthew 12_43-45\|Matthew 12:43-45]]* #bible-verse 

The former house of an unclean spirit is the legal right that allows the demon to be there in the first place. Royal priests destroy these houses when they forgive with the Blood of Jesus and the word of their testimony. Because of this, the rights of the unclean spirits to return to the house from which they came are stripped, and the accuser is cast down. Simply stated, there is no longer a house for them to return to. They are now homeless. #legal-right #royal-priest #forgiveness #blood #jesus #accuser 

### WIPING THE BATHTUB CLEAN

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I have given you authority to...overcome all the power of the enemy.” [[Luke 10_19\|Luke 10:19]]* #bible-verse 

There is not always time to neutralize the nucleus first. Sometimes you will find a person in bad shape, manifesting demons right on the spot. When this happens, you need to shut down the manifestation so you can get to the roots. Dealing with the outer layers first is a long and painful process, so you are always better off getting the manifestation to stop and then working from the inside out. This will mean either casting out the demon or stripping them of their ability to interfere with God’s work while you are praying. #root #demon #layer #prayer #authority 

When casting out a demon, the first rule of thumb is to stay calm. Demons are trying to control the environment, which they can only do if you let them or agree that they are dominant. Your decision to not allow them to manipulate your emotions (specifically fear) will establish this at the forefront.  The more

we Terraform, the more authority we receive from God, and the more confidence we have that our prayers will affect the person’s condition. #prayer #authority #god #confidence #rest #trust 

Remember that demons manifest by name or purpose. They are easy to spot by the words spoken by the person. If the person is angry, the demon is anger. If the person is afraid, the demon is fear. If the person becomes frenzied, the demon could be insanity or frenzy. The point is that you now know what you are dealing with. To shut down or cast out a demon before you’ve obtained the rights to permanently remove them, pray this:  #anger #freedom #authority #demons #discernment #terraforming 

*“Father, I ask You for grace. Lord You love Jim so much and want him to be healed. I ask You to give us the safe environment to get him set free. Even though the rights are not yet stripped, I ask you to enforce our words with power.” *Then say this for each demon that manifests, *“Demon of fear, I bind you, muzzle you, and strip you of all rights to manifest while we are praying.”* #sample-prayer 

The next step is to ask the Lord to reveal the roots, the hidden sins in the Light of His Presence ([[Psalm 90_8\|Ps. 90:8]]). The hidden sins are those that have given these demons the right to manifest in the person’s life. Once you find the sin, all that is needed is to fully forgive the sinner and cast down the accuser. The short version sounds like this:  #bible-verse #root #legal-right 

*“We forgive Jim’s father of witchcraft. We wash his feet with the Blood of Jesus that the power of his sins are broken. All witchcraft is dismantled, unraveled, and undone, rendered powerless to harm Jim. They are purified of this unrighteousness, redeemed of every consequence, and restored to the men of God they were created to be. We cast down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.”* #sample-prayer

The demon of fear that you previously bound and held until the root was discovered has just lost all rights to torment and afflict Jim. You are now ready to permanently remove the demon from Jim’s life. From our bathtub analogy, we have turned on the Light, soaked the grime with disinfectant (Blood), and are now ready to wipe the detached grime off of the bath tub (Authority). #root #revelation #sin #light-of-jesus  #forgiveness #blood-of-Jesus  #purified #demon #fear  #authority

The root of the fear has been discovered and destroyed through the manifestation of love in the forgiveness of Jim’s father.

The most common question we hear is, “OK, but where are we supposed to cast these demons? Out into mid air? Doesn’t that just leave the demon available to torment someone else?” There are many suggestions I’ve heard for the answer to this question, anywhere from “yes, mid air is fine” to “the outer darkness.” For those new to this authority, I believe the best answer is “to the Feet of Jesus ([[Romans 16_20\|Rom. 16:20]]).” The reason for this is that we know that Jesus is the Judge, and He will determine what happens to them after that. #bible-verse 

That being said, I am convinced that the Lord is in the process granting us the authority to cast demons into the abyss for torment, both permanently and temporary. Some may argue that this is not what Jesus did, specifically in [[Luke 8_31\|Luke 8:31]] when the demons begged Him not to order them into the abyss and He chose not to. But I believe that Jesus demonstrated to us that this decision is one made by a mature son or daughter of God, is not done in every instance, and requires relationship between us and our Lord to know when to and when not to. Without question, the right to cast into the abyss surfaces when the demon is trying to meddle with the DNA of a human through the combination of witchcraft and incest ([[2 Peter 2_4\|2 Pet. 2:4]]). But until you have this authority through experience and relationship, I advise casting to the feet of Jesus. #bible-verse #authority #jesus #sons-and-daughters #relationship #maturity 

### FLUSH THE BUSHES

Demons do not always manifest at first. Sometimes you need them to in order to identify who they are and what they are doing there. We call this “flushing the bushes.” Just like in hunting when you get the birds out of the bushes (hiding) and into the air (visible and easy to shoot), we do the same. This can be accomplished through various methods including worshiping, forgiving, or commanding them out.

My favorite is to ask the Lord to pour His All Consuming Fire into the person to roast out anything impure. *“He will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver.” [[Malachi 3_3a\|Mal. 3:3a]] *The heat of His Fire forces all impurities to the surface to be revealed

in the Light. *“I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire.” [[Revelation 3_18a \|Revelation 3:18a]] *God is so faithful! #bible-verse   #direction #demons #worship #forgiveness 

### DIGITAL AUDIO RECORDINGS

Let’s say you put on a digital audio recording of your favorite artist singing to the Lord. The sound quality is excellent. You are truly listening to that person sing this song. But is that artist actually in the room singing to you? No, of course not! What you have is a perfect recording of their voice that can be played over and over again, but not actually them doing the singing.

So too, demons operate with humans. They bring powerful temptations to the soul (mind, will, emotions) of a person to sin for generations. When you come along and remove that demon, the power source of the sin, the soul continues to “play recordings” of that demon because it has learned to do so. Not realizing this can be a source of great frustration when delivering a person of a demonic influence. People can sometimes mimic the demon after you’ve removed it. It might not seem like it, but the demon is gone. #generational-sins #demon 

The mind especially needs to be healed of this trauma. There are many ways that the evil one brings destruction and disfunction to the mind after years of abuse. We pray for the soul to be healed just like we do a broken arm, deafness, or cancer. We ask the Lord to heal that body part instantaneously, or through process, in accordance with His Will. Equally, we ask Him to heal that part of the soul. This part of deliverance takes the longest. You can cast out a demon in minutes, but the healing of the soul takes however long God says. He knows best. In His timing and sequence, a person is healed safely and permanently. Both are fundamental objectives of deliverance. #generational-sins #temptation #sin #soul #demon #trauma #god #His-will #healing #heart-of-God #deliverance #evil-one
