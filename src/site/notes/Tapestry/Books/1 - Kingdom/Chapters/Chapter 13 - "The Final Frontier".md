## Chapter 13: The Final Frontier

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."”[[Tapestry/Bible/Luke 23_34a\|Luke 23:34a]]* #bible-verse 

We know our bodies. They have been with us since we were born and our memories began. As we mature mentally, our bodies do the same growing from a small stature to a larger one. Our body is on earth, it is visible, and we can tangibly see when something goes wrong with it through symptoms. Our spirit is another matter altogether. Our spirit is invisible (by the natural eye) and is seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus ([[Tapestry/Bible/Ephesians/Ephesians 2_6\|Eph. 2:6]]). Learning to operate out of our spirit primarily is a topic for another time. For now, let’s suffice to say that the part of us that is seated with God is receiving from God, and therefore should be leading our being. #bible-verse #spirit 

The soul (mind, will, emotion) is our weak spot. Like our body, it is on earth, yet the soul is invisible. We are born with the ability to use it, but like our body, we develop it over time. Not surprisingly, it is the invisible part that the enemy uses against us. This is the part of our being that must be set free, delivered, and healed for us to walk in the fullness of our calling. While this may seem simple, it is actually far from it. Our soul develops habits of behavior over time that become a significant part of our personality. It affects how we perceive inputs, what choices we make, and our basic temperament. Although the emotions and especially the mind are a big part of this, it is the will that houses the part of us that will either be Love or not Love. #soul #choice #change #journey #love #not-love #maturity

The final frontier for the people of God is our freewill which is constantly being deceived by the evil one. Hurling down the accuser allows us to pull the plug on the power in the building and unlock the door. But it is up to the prisoners to choose to leave the prison or it is all for naught. Even with the Light on, human beings can remain blind if we choose not to open our eyes. Before we move on with more advanced topics, we must understand and then master the process of bringing Truth to people so they are not left behind. War has always been a team based sport. Individual accomplishment is important for the sake of contribution, but if the team loses, we all lose. The stakes are eternity so we have no room for error. Failure means the ultimate penalties for the lost. There can be absolutely, positively, no stragglers.

### PREDESTINATION

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them. To one he gave five talents of money, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.” [[Tapestry/Bible/Matthew/Matthew 25_14-15\|Matt. 25:14-15]]* #bible-verse 

God created each of us to be unique and different, but He loves us all the same. To say that we are created the same, however, is not correct. When we were created, the Lord predestined us for a specific calling that is different from our neighbor’s. To some He gives more gifting. To others, less, each according to the calling that the person was created for. The perversion of this truth of the Lord is when the enemy deceives people into believing that entire races of humans are superior or inferior and justify any kind of behavior that is “not love” under this lie. The truth is that each individual is loved the same, but gifted quite differently. #love #gift #truth #not-love #choice #journey

>*“But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed say to him who formed it, ‘Why have you made me like this?’ Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?” [[Tapestry/Bible/Romans/Romans 9_20-21\|Romans 9:20-21]]* #bible-verse

It is so important that we remember our responsibility to avoid judgement, that is, avoid deciding the eternal fate of any human being for benefit (heaven) or detriment (hell). That is not our job, it belongs to Jesus. When Paul discusses honor and dishonor, or mercy and wrath, or noble and common purposes, he is talking about a person’s role on earth within time and what fruit is produced for the overall benefit of the Kingdom of God. Just as the Lord gave ten talents to one person but only one talent to another, each according to their ability. It is contrary to the teaching of Jesus to judge that Pharaoh and Esau (all from Romans 9) are in hell just because “Esau I hated” and because the purpose of Pharaoh’s birth was to show the power of God. #heaven #hell #jesus #kingdom #journey #fruit #judgment 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“...for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.” [[Tapestry/Bible/Romans/Romans 11_29\|Romans 11:29]]* #bible-verse

A person must choose from their own freewill to obey God, accept His invitation, fulfill that which is expected, and respond to the proposal with “I do.” In short, we must say “yes” to God when He calls or we will miss our destiny. Jonah was predestined to minister to the people of Nineveh. Until he changed his answer from “no” to “yes” he did not walk in this destiny. Due to the impact of his calling, the Lord went out of His way to push the issue, but Jonah still made a free choice. So must we all. #choice #freewill #invitation #heart-of-God 

Our will is not predestined to say “yes” to God. We are free to choose Love or not love. Certainly it is correct that God knows what choices we will make. It is His prerogative to invest more into the lives of those persons that will choose well. But that does not influence our freedom to choose. Only His calling on our lives and the gifts He gives us to accomplish this calling are predestined and irrevocable. That is, we can operate with these gifts for their intended purposes regardless of whether we operate within the Will of the Father or not. It is imperative that we do ([[Matthew 7_21-23 \|Matt. 7:21-23]]) for eternal fruit to be produced for the Kingdom of God, but if we do not, God will not revoke the gift or the call. #bible-verse #love #not-love #invitation  #journey   #fruit #kingdom #father #gift #choice  #heart-of-God

Nonetheless, we cannot identify our will as being the source of our salvation. We are not saved by works, they are a byproduct of the Holy Spirit within us. The one and only source of our salvation is Christ Jesus who fully met the requirements of the law of God on our behalf ([[Tapestry/Bible/Romans 8_3-4\|Rom. 8:3-4]]). If our will makes the eternal choice of Love, we still must give God the glory for having access to eternal life through the Lamb of God. #bible-verse #identity #salvation #holy-spirit #jesus #choice #glory

>*“Then the man who had received the one talent came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground.* *See, here is what belongs to you.' His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant!’” [[Tapestry/Bible/Matthew/Matthew 25_24-26a\|Matthew 25:24-26a]]*  #bible-verse 

 
A strategy of the evil one is to deceive men and women of God into burying their gifts in the ground to avoid entering into heresy. This fear of error has paralyzed many in the Body of Christ in this day. While it is good practice to watch for any and all deception, sons and daughters of God who have received the Holy Spirit and have submitted all to God will trust Him for everything, including protection from heresy. Our intimate relationship with the Lord gives us the reassurance that we can walk down any path, no matter how it looks from our standpoint. The question is, did the Lord ask you to walk down the path? If so, say “yes” and go. #evil-one #sons-and-daughters #shame #fear #gift #church #holy-spirit #intimacy #relationship #trust

The Lord is desperate for the remnant to become a sea again. He wants every person on earth to choose Love over not love. The theology that God has predetermined who goes to heaven and who does not fails to reflect the heart of God. Our Lord cries out for the lost sheep. Jesus was adamant in His communication with Peter about feeding His lambs.  He died for the sins of all

that none should perish. If a single human spirit is lost to the Kingdom simply because that person failed to receive the gift of Jesus Christ, the Lord laments with agony. We should too. #heart-of-God #His-will #rescue #calling 

When we understand the heart of the Father, we remember that He rejoices at the return of the prodigal sons. He also wants the prodigal’s brother to share His heart and rejoice as well. We are a family, and so everything that belongs to our Father also belongs to us. Without our lost siblings we are less than what we were created to be. As adult children, we begin to see creation with the eyes of our Father. It is not His creation that we are fighting for a position of status or a quantity / quality of possessions. It is OUR creation that we share with our family. When the family loses, we lose. When the family gains, we gain. #heart-of-God #His-will #jesus #father #spirit #kingdom #creation #rescue #calling

>*“The Lord is not slack concerning His promise...but is long- suffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.” [[Tapestry/Bible/2 Peter/2 Peter 3_9\|2 Peter 3:9]]* #bible-verse 

All of this is to say that our mindset must be focused on realizing that what is done in heaven may not be done on earth in our time. We cannot allow our decisions and actions to be influenced towards laziness just because something is done in heaven, is the Will of God, and has been proclaimed as truth on the earth. The journey from Egypt to the Promised Land should have been 40 days. It took 40 years. Equally, the maturing of the Church of Jesus Christ from infancy to adulthood could have taken 20 years. It has taken 2,000 years. We are the generation that will fulfill the prophesy of Jesus that the prince of this world will be defeated, his prisoners released, and the Kingdom of God established. We have a vested interested in this happening. It is our family. We are the Kingdom of God on earth. #heaven #earth #His-will #seasons #maturing #jesus #kingdom #god 

### DECEPTION

*“You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” [[Tapestry/Bible/John/John 8_44\| John 8:44]]* #bible-verse

Needless to say, it is the evil one’s full time job to deceive the Body of Christ into believing ANYTHING but the truth. Why? Because his kingdom depends upon it. As long as the children of God never grow up, there is nothing to replace him. Through the power of our tongues as children of God created in His image, we can become his drones that build and maintain his empire indefinitely. He wants his kingdom to last forever ([[Tapestry/Bible/Isaiah/Isaiah 47_7\|Isa. 47:7]]), which is possible ([[Tapestry/Bible/Isaiah/Isaiah 47_12\|Isa. 47:12]]), but will not happen ([[Tapestry/Bible/Isaiah/Isaiah 47_15\|Isa. 47:15]]). He wants to tempt the humans of earth with sweetness of sugar-coated, harmful choices. Once the sugar has melted away with digestion, what is left is the revelation of the lie: the choice was not truly sweet, but terribly bitter. When the ultimate revelation of truth comes at death, the devil discards the dead battery in the trash and replaces them with a living vessel that can be deceived until their death. There is no Love whatsoever in the kingdom of darkness. We are used, abused, and then thrown away. #bible-verse #evil-one #truth #god #not-love #kingdom #deception #choice #kingdom-of-darkness

>*“He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.'”* [[Tapestry/Bible/Luke/Luke 16_27-28\|Luke 16:27-28]]* #bible-verse  

This is where we make our stand. We are fighting for the freewill choices of our siblings who are deceived and lost. Our job is not to disrupt their freedom of choice, but to remove the deception of the enemy that influences them towards harmful choices that seem beneficial. By bringing Truth to them now, they have the best opportunity of avoiding “*this place of torment*” when the Truth is ultimately revealed in death. #deception #rescue #freedom #choice #truth #freewill 

Jesus spoke this out on the cross ([[Tapestry/Bible/Luke/Luke 23_34\|Luke 23:34]]) when He asked the Lord to forgive mankind for its actions. We do not realize what we are doing. The enemy has blinded us to the Truth and is allowing us to take the blame. But it is the heart of our Father that we all be saved. The atonement from the Lamb of God was intended for every person created. Daddy is looking to His adult children to bring His Will from heaven to earth. To see It established as His Word. #bible-verse #freewill #freedom #choice #truth #heart-of-God #jesus #father #sons-and-daughters #His-will #heaven #earth #relationship #adult-season

### HARD HEARTS

*“They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.” [[Tapestry/Bible/Ephesians/Ephesians 4_18-19\|Ephesians 4:18-19]]* #bible-verse

The challenge of our calling comes with the reality that many people are so deceived that they want to be in darkness and will resist the Light. Some are addicted to the sweetness of the sugar- coating, while others are wounded and consider the deception to be a defense against further pain. Others still are fully deceived. They have no idea that they are walking in the fog of the lies of satan. God gives us grace to repent, but if we do not, the all consuming fire will reveal the Truth publicly. This can be through the exposure of a man of God hiding in sin, or the judgement of a nation lost to the Lord for portraying goodness on the outside, while inside it is rotten to the core. #deception #deliverance #light-of-jesus #rescue #grace #fire #revelation #truth #judgment #repentance #rejection 

No matter what the reason why their heart has become hardened, they are still highly desired members of our family. They are unique creations with gifts and a calling that the Kingdom needs. Like them, we were once lost but now are found. The Lord wants them back and so do we. But if our mandate is to never override the will of another person, as this sets us up as a false god in their lives (idolatry and witchcraft), how do we rescue these lost sheep?  #heart #darkness #light #deception #truth #sin #judgment #witchcraft  #idolatry  #gifts #kingdom #heart-of-God 

### INTERCEDING FOR THE FREEWILL

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, ‘See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.” [[Tapestry/Bible/John/John 5_14\|John 5:14]]* #bible-verse 

When Jesus delegated to us the authority to forgive sins through the Holy Spirit within us, He did not replace the need for repentance in the lives of those we forgive. Without repentance, their condition could end up being worse than it was before we forgave them. This did not stop Jesus from setting the captives free, but it is an important consideration as we learn to move in the commission that Jesus has sent us with. This authority was

reserved for the adult age of the Church because it requires wisdom and experience in our relationship with the Lord to avoid harming those we are called to serve. #authority #forgiveness #repentance #jesus #maturity #adult-season 

See chapter 18 on Dismantling for details on how to pray for a person with a hardened heart. The key is when we ask the Lord for intervention in their lives. While we can break the power of the enemy’s hold on their lives, we ultimately need His revelation of Truth to snap the person out of the trance that they are held in. Demons must be replaced with loyal angels to protect them and minister life to their damaged hearts. They need to be covered in His incubator of grace that the upper hand of the Kingdom of God would prevail in their lives. #jesus #authority  #forgiveness #sin #holy-spirit #maturity  #wisdom #pray #revelation #truth #demons #grace #kingdom #angel #rescue
