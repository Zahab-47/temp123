## Chapter 5: The Blood of Jesus

> [!quote]+
>*[Christ] did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once and for all by His own Blood, having obtained eternal redemption. [[Hebrews 9_12\| Hebrews 9:12]]* #bible-verse 
>
>*“Jesus answered, ‘A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean.’ [[John 13_10\| John 13:10]]* #bible-verse 

It is difficult to fathom the power of the Blood of Jesus. It is above all history, actions, and deeds. The Blood impacts reality both on Earth and in Heaven. All of the requirements for entering the Presence of God are met with the Blood. Instead of cleansing ourselves through the sacrifice of animals, we can receive the Blood of Jesus and be totally clean. Instead of washing our hands and feet at the laver ([[Exodus 40_30-31\|Ex. 40:30-31]]), we are washed by the Blood. When we first believed, God gave our entire body a bath by crucifying our sinful nature ([[Galatians 5_24\|Gal. 5:24]]). From that day forward ([[Luke 9_23\|Luke 9:23]]), we must continue to diligently wash our feet ([[John 13_10\|John 13:10]]), that is, be cleansed of the daily impurities that get on us. In Terraforming, that means preparing our lives as priests by washing with the Blood of Jesus every day. #bible-verse

##### SIN

> [!quote]+
> *"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' [[Matthew 7_21-23\|Matthew 7:21-23]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus gave us the definition of sin. It is simply put, doing anything outside of the Will of the Father. We can narrow this down to the word ‘disobedience,’ but not without clarification. Moses captured God’s Will in the written law. Prophets from Samuel to Malachi and on to the present time have spoken God’s Will to us. The Apostles wrote His Will in their letters to the brethren. The Lord speaks His Will to us in our hearts as we mature in Him, we begin to hear His Voice and respond to it. When we choose anything that is outside of Him, we have sinned. #sin #His-will 

Sin separates us from God. With all that is at stake (see [[Matthew 3_12,25-41\|Matt. 3:12, 25:41]], and [[Luke 16_19-31\|Luke 16:19-31]] for details), we cannot accept anything less than complete redemption from our sin, especially when it is offered by God and came at a terrible price. What happens when we sin against God and commit a trespass against our neighbor? We suffer consequences such as deception, division, destruction, and death. The power of sin results in torment and affliction and also opens the door to other sins. Sin provides the legal right for the enemy to torment and afflict. The Blood of Jesus provides the legal right for God’s people to be free. #bible-verse #legal-right #blood-of-Jesus #freedom #rescue 

The Blood of Jesus is the literal representation of the new covenant with the Lord  ([[Luke 22_20\|Luke 22:20]]). Through it we are all saved, both Jew and Gentile alike ([[Romans 1_16 \|Rom. 1:16]]). For the Gentiles, this is a radical change in circumstances. Once we were born despised by our own Creator, now we are born again as sons and daughters with an inheritance of the eternal Kingdom. #bible-verse

Jesus Christ paid this price for us, that by His body that was bruised, we are healed. By His Blood we are saved from being eternally separated from Love, and from being cast into a lake of burning sulfur for ever and ever  ([[Revelation 21_8\|Rev. 21:8]]). #bible-verse #blood #jesus #heaven #priest 

The Blood also provides us with freedom in our lives here on earth. Jesus referred to this time as a harvest ([[Matthew 9_37-38\|Matthew 9:37-38]]) where seeds are planted in the hearts of people and the children of God are called as His servants for the work of reaping. For this work, we must be free, that is, healed from all iniquity in our bodies, our minds, and our souls. In chapter four we learned that the Light reveals the Truth and it is the Truth that sets us free. We stay free with the Blood of Jesus. We see this manifest through three properties of the Blood: purification, redemption, and restoration.

### PURIFICATION

> [!quote]+ 
>*“But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin.” [[1 John 1_7\|1 John 1:7]]* #bible-verse 

Purification is the process of ridding someone of anything harmful, such as sin. Sin represents both the exterior dirt that Aaron and his sons washed from their hands in [[Exodus 29_4\|Ex. 29:4]], and also the inner impurity that required the blood of goats. As being clean is a prerequisite of receiving the Presence of the Lord as He intends for us to, purification is a critical objective of Terraforming. Only the Blood of Jesus can do this for us. What a privilege to have this priceless gift from our God! #bible-verse #terraforming #purification #blood #jesus #light #redemption #restoration #sin 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.” [[Jeremiah 31_34c \| Jeremiah 31:34c]]* #bible-verse 

There is power in the memory of sin. In our minds it manifests as regret, shame, fear, anger, hurt, bitterness, grief, sorrow, and pain. In the spiritual realm, it serves as a legal right for the evil one to torment and afflict us. To be free from this torment, we must be washed with the Blood of Jesus. Here the power of the Blood once again astounds us. #blood-of-Jesus

We are washed so clean, it is as if the history has been rewritten and the sin never occurred in the first place. God will remember our sins no more. He has no memory of it. God is God. When God doesn’t remember something, it isn’t denial. It is because that thing doesn’t exist anymore, not even in His memory!  #restoration  #legal-right #blood #jesus #sin #shame #fear #grief #purification #grace 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.”[[Psalm 103_12 \|Psalm 103:12]]* #bible-verse 

This is a reason for great celebration. The Truth, who is Christ Jesus, truly did set us free. His Blood bought us separation from our sin so that the power of the sin is broken and we can now die to the sin ([[Colossians 3_5\|Col. 3:5]]) for good. Abstaining from sin is futile effort without the Blood of Jesus. With the power of sin intact, the evil one comes with temptation that is nearly impossible to resist for long. With the power broken, it is like breaking a habit you haven’t formed yet. It is like quitting something that is addicting, when you’ve never been addicted to it. The addiction / habit are removed so that you feel like you never had them in the first place. Praise be to our Lord for setting us free indeed! #bible-verse #truth #jesus #temptation #blood #freedom  

### REDEMPTION

> [!quote]+ 
>*“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace.” [[Ephesians 1_7 \|Ephesians 1:7]]* #bible-verse 

Redemption can be defined as the removal of an obligation such as a debt, or in this case, the consequence of sin, which is death ([[Romans 6_23\|Rom. 6:23]]). Using “deliverance” as a synonym, we can refer to redemption as being rescued from captivity, hardship, or domination by evil. The Blood of Jesus literally cancels the debt of sin while simultaneously freeing us from the legal right of satan to torment us and afflict us. The removal of these rights is critical to preparing us for the Presence of God. More will be discussed in the chapter, “The Authority of Jesus.” #redemption #rescue #blood #jesus #choice #sin #authority #generational-sins 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.”* [[1 Peter 1_18-19\|1 Pet. 1:18-19]]*

Not all of the power of sin that inflicts us is the result of choices that we made. Some are inherited. The Lord *“punishes the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation ([[Numbers 14_18\|Num. 14:18]]).” *Your sins can be passed to your children, your grandchildren, and your great-grandchildren. It is possible to be suffering right now from an affliction that is claimed as a right by the enemy due to the actions of these distant relatives, or forefathers. The rights are stripped by the Blood of Jesus. Terraforming a person must always include dealing with the sins of our forefathers to ensure that these rights do not result in impurities that will limit the Presence of God.

### RESTORATION

> [!quote]+
> *“But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.” [[Ephesians 2_13\|Ephesians 2:13]]* #bible-verse

Restoration can be defined as returning something to a former condition, in this case, back to a right relationship with God. While sin separates us from God, we are reconciled in Christ through His mighty Blood. When praying for a place such as your house, the Blood of Jesus restores the land to its condition prior to being defiled by the sins of the people that have been there. Restoration also includes returning the person to the state that God designed them to be in before they were born. God has an identity that He has chosen for us when He created us ([[Ephesians 1_11\|Eph. 1:11]]). It starts with us as sons and daughters of the King with an inheritance. It ends with the specific role that we play in the body of Christ. We walk into this identity through the reconciliation and restoration power of the Blood of Jesus. #blood-of-Jesus #restoration #sin #reconciliation #defilement #identity #design #inheritance #purification #return #repentance #forgiveness #cleansing 

> [!quote]+
> *“’Come now, and let us reason together,’ Says the LORD, ‘Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.’” Isaiah 1:18* #bible-verse

The end result of receiving the Blood of Jesus is that we are presented holy and blameless before the Lord. We are ready to eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord in a worthy manner as we are now in a right relationship with God ([[1 Corinthians 11_27\|1 Cor 11:27]]). #bible-verse #restoration #relationship #blood-of-Jesus  #jesus #communion #inheritance #purification 

### TERRAFORMING WITH THE BLOOD

God wants us to be clean before entering His Presence. In the Old Testament, this was accomplished by a laver ([[Exodus 29_4\|Ex. 29:4]]) and through the blood of animals ([[Exodus 29_21\|Ex. 29:21]]). In the New Covenant, Jesus washes our entire body when we first come to Him. But on a daily bases, we need to have our feet washed. Jesus knows that we will sin, maybe not intentionally, but it will happen. Just as the feet will get dirty from walking in Israel with sandals on, we will get dirty from walking in this world. He and only He can wash us clean.
