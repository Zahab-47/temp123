# Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Pastor Bill Johnson of Redding, California, Pastor Neville Johnson (no relation) of Queensland, Australia, and Arthur Burk of Anaheim, California for saying “yes” to God and therefore being available to be used without your knowledge in my life on many occasions.

Special thanks to Larry & Paula Palmer of the Tulsa Healing Center, and Stacia Thompson / Elaine Perkins of the International Association of Healing Rooms for having the love in your hearts to release what Daddy has given to the church. #healing-rooms

Unending gratitude to the members of Stryper for rescuing me from the bandits. #stryper

Love always to my children (in the spirit and in the natural) for their support, encouragement, and enduring these last three years with a smile. A multitude of blessings to my father, John E. Norvell for raising me in faith, and my mother, Rosemary Justice Norvell for raising me in love. #gma

And then Shari...
Scott wouldn’t have gotten far without Shari. #migdal 

Jesus Christ is King, SJN

### What is Terraforming?

Power and authority are given to [[Tapestry/WIKI/Articles/satan\|satan]] and [[kingdom of darkness\|his kingdom]] every time we freely choose to [[sin\|sin]]. This is the motivation for the evil one to lie, steal, kill, and destroy to get humans to believe that their choices are founded in [[Truth\|Truth]], when they are not. These sins are presented in heaven (court room) by the [[accuser\|accuser]] (plaintiff) against all of mankind (defendant) day and night. #sin #satan #accuser #kingdom-of-darkness #power #authority #choice #court-room #legal-right #heaven

As the [[Tapestry/WIKI/Articles/Light of Jesus\|Light of Jesus]] reveals the root sin, [[Tapestry/WIKI/Articles/royal priests\|royal priests]] strip evil of these rights by [[Full Forgiveness\|fully forgiving]] the person who sinned, sprinkling them with the [[Tapestry/WIKI/Articles/blood of Jesus\|blood of Jesus]]. The accuser is then hurled down by the [[word of their testimony\|word of their testimony]], which describes what the blood of Jesus did for the sinner: they are [[Full Forgiveness\|purified of all unrighteousness, redeemed of every debt, and restored near to God]]. #sin #satan #accuser #kingdom-of-darkness #light-of-jesus #word-of-testimony #sin #root #royal-priest #legal-right #full-forgiveness #purification #redemption #restoration #authority-of-christ #freedom #reconciliation 

It is with this [[Authority of Christ\|authority of Jesus]] that royal priests dismantle the kingdom of darkness, thereby setting the captives free. The people of God can then gather these newly freed disciples (learners), impart to them the [[Gospel\|Gospel of Jesus Christ]], and then release them into their [[irrevocable gifts and callings\|irrevocable gifts and callings]] for which Christ Jesus took ahold of them. When this happens across the entire world, creation will be reformed, or (“_terra”_ - _Latin :_ _earth_) (“_forma”_ - _Latin :_ _molded_), Terraformed for the Kingdom of God. #kingdom-of-darkness #authority-of-christ #terraforming #royal-priest #freedom #discipleship #creation #gospel

As royal priests, we are preparing creation (people, places, things) for His [[God's Presence\|Presence]] through His Light ([[Psalm 43_3\|Psalm 43:3]]), His Blood ([[Hebrews 10_19\|Hebrews 10:19]]), and His Authority ([[John 20_21\|John 20:21]]). #bible-verse #royal-priest #creation #presence-of-god #blood-of-Jesus #light-of-jesus #authority-of-christ #terraforming

This is a very exciting time that we live in. All of creation has been groaning for this time since the beginning. Our forefathers dreamed of doing what we will do. This is the generation that seeks the face of God and will stand in the Holy Place of His Presence. In this generation, we do not love our lives even unto death. Like all previous generations, we have been irrevocably called by God, but unlike all other generations, we have answered “yes” and then done what was asked of us. #expectant #relationship #activation #maturity 

You are alive to see these times. The prophesy of Revelation 12 is being fulfilled in our very midst. I bless you to read on and hear the good news that God is speaking from the heavens through His people across the world. What you are reading is only a part of a much bigger picture. Yet it is a foundation. A cry in the wilderness for the Royal Priests to come to attention and begin the work that we were created to do.

Everything that you read here came in three parts. The first was pure revelation.  Downloads from our Father in Heaven that

manifested as a deep sense of knowing. To move forward from this point required courage. There was risk involved with sharing things that had not been understood before. But risk taking is the building block of Faith. From here, the Lord provided opportunities for fruit to be produced. And there has been much of that, from people being saved, healed, and delivered, to supernatural miracles in the land.

The Lord provided scripture last to confirm the revelation He had given. Why? He did not want us to search the scriptures trying to get life instead of coming to Him to have life. And so the Royal Priests have been commissioned to prepare all of creation for His Presence.

Here is the exciting part. If the Lord sends us to prepare for Him, doesn’t that mean that He is coming? It does. He is coming with Fire and He will anoint us to do the things that our forefathers only dreamed of.

## Chapter 1: Creation 
#chapter #love #not-love #choice #heart-of-God #relationship 

<br>
An author of books was the sole survivor of a shipwreck. He drifted for days on wooden planks before reaching dry land. The island that he found was perfect for sustaining life, it had freshwater, fruit trees, and the raw materials for shelter. But soon he found himself bored to tears. As an author, he realized that he could write his next book right there on the island and it would be ready to go for publishing as soon as he was rescued. Although drenched, his backpack had survived the wreck. The pencils worked fine, but his pads of paper took days to dry out before he could get started.

His next step was to choose a plot. But for some reason he found himself with writer’s block. Try as he could, there was simply nothing that held his attention to write about. He thought of several adventure stories, but all seemed bland. He had some ideas about betrayal and intrigue, but they were of no interest to him. After days and days of thinking, contemplating, and adjusting, he was about to give up on writing altogether.

One day he realized that he was extremely lonely. After several months alone, he was starving for any kind of human contact. Yet day after day, there were no signs of rescuers to be seen. Eventually, his need for love became unbearable and he decided that action was required. With the objective of curing loneliness, the author realized that a book about robots would be fun, but would not provide the love that he desperately needed. He was not yet a father, so he decided that his story would be a fictional

account of his children that he believed would be born once he was rescued and got married.

Not having kids before, he wasn’t sure where to begin. He always wanted both a boy and a girl, so he decided to write his book about an older teenaged son named Eric and a younger teenaged daughter named Tiana. He had a fairly good idea what he wanted them to look like (their dad) so he moved on to their interests, hobbies, talents, and aspirations in life. When he finished he realized that this story had great potential of being a blockbuster. The author was very encouraged. He felt like this crazy idea just might work in both ways, passing time productively while he waited to be rescued, and curing his loneliness.

That night he fell into a deep sleep. To his surprise and utter joy, Eric and Tiana were in his dream. They interacted with him as children do, with fierce love for their daddy. He talked to them and shared his heart with them. He told them things he had never told any other person. They both learned much from him. Eric wanted to be a writer one day too. Tiana just wanted to curl up in daddy’s arms and tell him all about her pony.

When the author woke up he cried with joy. Eric and Tiana were like real children of his that he loved deeply, admired, and quite frankly was proud of. He wrote down everything that happened in the dream, developing the characters into complex, true-to-life people with great potential ahead of them. This continued for weeks. He would go to sleep at night, dream of his kids, and then wake up the next day and write the story based upon the events in the dream, or events he made up based upon their personalities. All day long while cooking or fixing problems with his shelter, he would anticipate that night’s dream with his babies.

He decided to create other people to build the story. He gave them each a friend and a guard that watched over them day and night. He put them in a town where they could interact with many different people in countless scenarios that would demonstrate the strength of their character. They were very popular around town. Everyone knew their names and appreciated what loving children they were.  Whenever the

author introduced someone new in his book, they would appear in his dreams that night behaving just as he wrote them out to be.

The author began to notice something amazing. At night the stories would take on a life of their own. Although he would write down basic characteristics about each person, they would do things in his dreams that were not written by him but were extensions of those characteristics. He created them as if they were real humans like himself, and this is how they behaved in his dream. They were aware of themselves, thought, spoke, and freely chose to do what suited them best. It was as if the characters were writing the story with him. Every day he would say to himself, *“if only every book I wrote was this easy!”*

Then one night the author fell asleep. As his dream began, there was great commotion going on in town. He ran through the streets to find out what was the matter. He heard a familiar voice cry out, *“Dad!” *Just then Eric ran up and cried out, *“We can’t find Tiana anywhere!” *The author panicked. He thought of his beautiful daughter and how much he loved her. It was too much to bear! Finally, a witness was found who said that he saw Tiana’s guard kidnapping her. He had taken her by force with his hand over her mouth, onto her horse, and ridden away to the north.

The author woke up in a cold sweat. He was very angry. It was beyond his reckoning that the guard that he had created, with valor, courage, and might had betrayed him in such a way. The very purpose for his creation was to protect her. He had violated his own meaning by becoming the threat to her safety. While writing his book that day, the author wrote in a rescue party led by Eric. He included every supply that he would need to get his sister back. Nothing was left to chance. He couldn’t wait to get back to his created world and find his dearest daughter.

That night the author dreamed that he organized the rescue party with Eric at the helm. They were staffed with 1,000 soldiers, every food supply, weapon, and resource needed to survive months of searching if needed. But finding her wasn’t the problem. The army came back after only a few weeks. Eric rode up to his dad with the report of what they found.

*“Tiana’s guard took her to the mountains in the north. The trail was hot and we found them quickly. But in the days while they traveled, her guard gave her an extract from a plant growing in the fields. It intoxicated her to keep her from struggling. She has become addicted to the substance and it has changed her personality drastically. She refused to come back with us and is threatening to kill herself if we come back.”*

The author woke up. He cried for hours and screamed out, *“NO! Tiana don’t do it! Come back to me!” *His dearest daughter that he loved so much was lost to him and it was more than he could bear. His emotions ranged from heartbreak, to downtrodden angst, to downright anger. He was mad at her for what she was doing. But nothing could stop him from remembering the girl that she truly was. The one that was a woman of might, the one he created her to be. He forgave her and knew that the only chance was for him to go and get her himself.

That night the author dreamed that he mounted a horse and rode north with Eric at his side. They found the traitor guard and Tiana almost immediately. The author dismounted and motioned to Eric to stay behind him. The guard, feeling confident with only two foes to defeat, rose to his feet with his sword drawn. But the author wasn’t there for combat. He knew that to free his daughter, he had to remove the source of her bondage. She did not know how to make the addictive extract. The guard did.

The author lunged towards the guard with a hidden dagger exposed as it was plunging into his heart. Unabated, the guard extended his own sword that the author had to go through to get to his foe. Both were dealt fatal blows. They fell to the ground to take their last breaths. Tiana, seeing her daddy dying, snapped out of her trance and jumped to his side. With Eric next to her, the author said, *“Son, care for your sister. I have forgiven her. You do the same.” *Tiana, cried out with grief. *“Daddy I am so sorry!” *The author replied, *“I love you, I did this because I love you. Never forget. Your daddy loves you.” *He died in their arms.

The author woke up. Two men were shaking him to see if he was alive. It was a ship! They had found him and were able to take him home.  He thanked them whole heartily, rode the ship

home, and went on to publish his book. He never dreamed of Eric and Tiana again. But the book was a big hit. It became a bestseller on both sides of the ocean. He titled it, “Creation.” The author got married and had two kids. A boy named Eric and a girl named Tiana. They both bore a striking resemblance to their daddy.

##### Love Defined

It can be difficult to grasp that God, and therefore we, will never end. Our minds struggle with it because it is an enormous picture to create. Yet our lives have continuously moved in a forward direction, so “never-ending” is something we can make work. Each of us have experienced growing up, graduations, projects completed, promotions, etc, but these are simply changes in life. If you are reading this, you have never experienced “ceasing to exist” (different from “death”), so with a little effort we can take a hold of “never-ending.” #never-ending #never-beginning #creation #eternal #eternity

The tough one is “never beginning.” No matter how you twist and turn, that one is hard to settle in with. We all have a “beginning” that lies within God’s act of creation. We have no memories before this event. This is where our attempts at emphasizing with God end. God has always been. The concept of God having no beginning while creation has a specific beginning is mind boggling. God created the heavens and the earth, but what happened before that? Let’s face it, God has had a LONG TIME to do many things before we were created. #never-ending #never-beginning #creation #eternal #eternity 

Imagine that you are God and it is now before creation was created. Who is God and why would you create in the first place? “God is love,” but what does that mean? We know that God defined “love” in this world as selfless affection, and “affection “ is defined as a fond or tender feeling towards somebody or something. A friend of mine used to say, “Love is having both empathy and common goals.”  In both examples,

love is a **relationship **between two or more things, and so we have a problem. You are God, and God is love, but there is only you. You are alone. Remember, this is before creation. So, whom or what do you love? #love #relationship 

We see that a requirement for “love” to exist is that there are at least two objects, the __lover__ and the __loved__. You can love yourself, but is that “love” in its complete form? It seems that the fullness of the definition of “love” demands that it is manifested three (3) ways: 1.) loving yourself, 2.) loving those that love you back, and 3.) loving those that hate you (enemies). This manifestation of love meets the requirement of at least two objects, and also provides a test in the loving of one’s enemies, as this love must be pure and unconditional. #love #blueprint 

The mind of God is to fully define love by creating those that love Him back ([[Matthew 22_37\|Matt. 22:37]]), and those that do not love Him back. It is also to *become the relationship *of love between the two or more beings that He created ( [[Matthew 22_39\|Matt. 22:39]], [[Matthew 18_20 \| Matt. 18:20]]). This is the reason for creation. Love is made complete in the creation, and God is love, so God has chosen to complete Himself through creation. We see this in marriage especially where “two are made one.” What a glorious role and purpose that we have!!! God has created us to complete himself. Some will love him back, others will not. Tested love is made perfect, and this is the purpose of creation, to have perfect love. #love #heart-of-God #blueprint #relationship #bible-verse #purpose #destiny 

### Offspring Defined

To complete “love,” God knew that His creation must be far more than the mechanical construction of machines and robots. First, His creation needed to be organic. That is, complex, precious, unique, and irreplaceable. This is the opposite of a machine, which can be replicated by design. We are not ever the same over time. We grow in body, soul, and spirit from the day we are born to the day we die. God chose to make each human being one of a kind. There will never be another ‘you.’ You are very special. This is an important attribute in creating something capable of perfecting love. #freedom #choice #love 

Second, God’s creation needed to have “choice,” or the freedom to choose.  God had no interest in creating robots that were

<p style="text-align:center;">

“preprogrammed” to love Him. He wanted His creation to choose to love Him. Freedom is another requirement for love to exist. Fond and tender feelings for another do not come from captivity, but in the freedom to choose from multiple options – and then choosing the one that is the best. #choice #love #freedom #relationship #heart-of-God 

> [!quote]+
> *"I said, 'You are "gods"; you are all sons of the Most High.'” [[Psalm 82_6 \|Psalm 82:6]]* #bible-verse
 
Essentially, God’s creation needed to be like Him, so He created the concept of “offspring,” or having children. In His brilliance, God knew that the best model for love would be to create “gods” that could complete this picture of “love” that He was painting. To fill this need, He made children - creation that was created “in His image” with similar attributes as Himself. These include freedom, choice, judgment, the ability to create, emotions, etc. #children #create 

God is BIG. God is God. So for God to create the “loved” there is a size gap that is tough to overlook. “Little me” is tiny next to God, and His awesomeness alone could cause us to be incapable of loving Him without the influence of fear, thus nullifying choice. To compensate for this, God hid Himself. It is possible to grow up on this planet and never know that God exists because He is not seen with our eyes or heard with our ears (in the natural world). This creates the concept of Faith, whereby the “loved” of God must believe in Him without seeing Him. #choice #love #faith #god #freewill #freedom #risk 

The second way God handled the size issue was to create many small children that are designed to fit together through love into a larger entity. This beautiful tapestry allowed our mighty and awesome God to pour His love out on more than just one child, while still accomplishing the goal of at least two objects: the lover and the loved. Not one child is more precious than the other – we fit together into one body. In this He created the concept of marriage, which was fulfilled through Christ and His church. #bride #one-flesh #marriage #love 

A final point to make is that there are problems that arise from choosing to create children. Six or seven billion people made in God’s image, with freedom of choice, is a dangerous thing. There are many implications that had to be dealt with. It takes a mighty God to keep the planet from imploding. All of this points

to the requirement of our fallibility and our need for a savior. It pains me to hear people say that they cannot believe in a God that would “allow children to suffer.” If only they understood that it pains God too. He does not want them to suffer, but allows humans to have their free choices so Love can be fully defined. #love #freewill #choice #heart-of-God 

### Heaven and Hell

To have love, there must be choice. But what are we choosing between? The simple answer is love and “not love,” which has been referred to by many as “good and evil.” God created good and evil, but did not force it upon us. We were allowed to choose even this very path and whether we would go down it or not. Adam and Eve made that choice on our behalf, but it was one that we all would have made as well. #choice #good-and-evil #not-love 

God called it the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil.” By eating the fruit of this tree, the human creation was choosing to see this picture completed. We are fulfilling the definition of “love” as we now know that there is good that we can choose and there is evil that we can choose. Because of this, there will be those that love Him back, and those that do not. Once we started down that path, we had to see it to completion. It was a one-way street. #good-and-evil #creation #love #choice 

For good and evil to exist without chaos, there had to be consequence, implication, and result. These are mandatory to the completion of love. From this came the concepts of benefit and detriment. As God has defined it, love is good. As such, “benefit” was assigned to choices of good and “detriment” was assigned to choices of evil. God is directing His creation towards Love. That is where His plan is heading.

Just as we are capable with effort to comprehend the concept of “never ending,” so too are we able to grasp “Heaven.” The idea of incomprehensible peace, joy, happiness, and above all love is like thinking of winning the lottery. We dream of Heaven with

ear-to-ear grins. The more we get to know our God, the more we want to spend all of our time with Him. Heaven is the culmination of creation: God the Lover and us the Loved. #heaven #love #heart-of-God #creation #never-ending

Along the lines of “never beginning,” the horrors of hell are beyond any nightmare we’ve ever encountered. The idea of being alone, in pain, suffering with unquenchable thirst is enough to make anyone tremble. Hell is real. It is the ultimate detriment that results from choosing “not love.” We are free to make whatever choice we want to, and we receive the consequence of those choices just the same. #not-love #never-beginning #choice 

### Fallibility

God created human beings in His image, but we are not exact replications of Him. We were made to depend upon Him for everything and to love Him back. The choice of Adam and Eve resulted in the door opening for those that will not love Him. But we are not quick to judge. We have all sinned ([[Romans 3_23\| Rom. 3:23]]) and the Lord said that “*the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur*” ([[Revelation 21_8\|Rev. 21:8]]). Knowing this, we realize just how desperately we need Jesus. #bible-verse #not-love #defilement #sin #choice #witchcraft 

We are created singular, that is one person. In this state, we find ourselves weak when it comes to our identity. We are created in His image, but we have found that behaving that way is a different story. When Adam and Eve bit into that apple, the evil one obtained the ultimate legal right, one that we were incapable of stripping him of. We received the knowledge of good and evil, thus empowering our ability to choose many times over what it was. But this also put us in the position of realizing our weakness: we were not capable of choosing good as God does. #evil-one #legal-right #choice

### Savior

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.”[[John 3_16 \| John 3:16]]* #bible-verse 

All of this presented our need for a savior. God knew that we needed a change in nature to be able to meet the qualifications of love. Therefore, He elevated us up to His level by sending His only Son into the world to live as one of us and die innocent. His blood brought about the ultimate change in condition: Redemption. We have become worthy of being called the Lover and Loved of God through the fullness of Christ within us who is our righteousness and makes us Holy and Blameless in the eyes of our Father. #blood-of-Jesus #forgiveness #redemption #restoration 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.” [[Romans 8_9b-10 \| Romans 8:9b-10]]* #bible-verse #change #spirit-of-God #redemption 

The author of life loved us so much that He died so we could be free and have real life. We were created in His image so we could be called His sons and daughters and not His slaves. But that meant our having the freedom to choose Love or not-love. This is required for Love to be fulfilled, but hard for the Author of Life because He must watch as we make choices that harm ourselves and his other children. Jesus died for us so we could become the worthy Lover and Loved of God. Now with His Light, Blood, and Authority, we are able to live as His children, bringing the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Will of the Father to earth as it is in Heaven. There is much to do. While we’ve been distracted with other things, the evil one has infested the earth with darkness. #jesus #heaven #love #not-love #sons-and-daughters #relationship #inheritance #distraction #evil-one

## Chapter 2: The Kingdom  
#chapter #bible-verse #relationship #inheritance #maturity 

> [!quote]+
> *“I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.” 
> [[2 Corinthians 6_18\| 2 Corinthians 6:18]]* #bible-verse 

A King of great wisdom, wealth, and power defeated all of His enemies. He conquered their lands once and for all. Yet the lands continue to be filled with evil marauders that perform guerrilla warfare to undermine the King’s authority and ultimately try to overthrow His government. Worse still, the marauders have kidnapped the King’s daughter. He loves all of His children greatly, but this was His youngest child. She was born small, the runt of the litter. She is helpless, afraid, and lost. Her Father knows this and He is desperate to get her back. He wants to see the culture of His Kingdom brought to all of the lands and the evil marauders captured and neutralized. But this is not a mission that He can assign to His paid servants. Those who are motivated by self can be easily derailed from the goal. This is a job that can only be handed to family, specifically His other sons and daughters.

Before the Father will send each child, they will have to grow up some. The babies cannot go. Only the children that are tall enough to ride a horse, and strong enough to wield the tools, and wise enough to handle the money can go on this expedition. The Father will choose those children with the maturity and character needed to endure the trials and challenges they will see on this journey. The King will be careful in sending any of His children that are wounded. Only those who walk in their healing are

strong enough for the trials to come. He will not put any of them in a position where they would fail in the mission or hurt themselves in the process. He loves His children very much. #allegory #relationship #maturity 

The Father has storehouses of provision, everything they will need for this mission. He has money, horses, food, tools, servants, an army, and even friends in high places that can offer assistance. But He knows His children well. To one, He cannot give $1 million dollars to because the son will end up losing it at the horse races. But His other daughter is very good with money – she has proven herself time and time again. To her the Father will entrust with the bank account. His other son is a master horse rider. The Father will give this son charge of the horses to transport the search party to find and return their sister home.

The Father wants the chosen, grown-up children to have His Heart, a heart of selfless love for His Family and the Kingdom. In the parable of the prodigal son, the brother was angry with his father for how he received his brother back. He said, *“Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends*.” His father responded, *“‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found’” ([[Luke 15_29,31-32\| Luke 15:29,31–32]])*. What the father is saying is, “son, if you had my heart, you would help me throw the party!!!!” If the brother had maturity and strength of character, his heart would be like his father’s. His response would be rejoicing and celebration! #bible-verse #storehouse #inheritance #maturity #heart-of-God #love

### Listeners Who Learn

The Father is very wise. He needs His children to trust His Wisdom and to listen to Him speak. He knows us better than we will ever know ourselves. He wants us to trust Him to teach us how to become the men and women we were created to be. He also knows where His lost daughter is and how to get her.  He

needs us to listen to His instructions and to receive His gifts so we will be successful in getting her back. He is aware that there are many distractions that would keep us from using the gifts He gives us unwisely or to delay our getting her home. #voice #trust 

The Father has sent us out with His Helper, the Holy Spirit, who leads us to His Will. God is speaking to us all the time, but many of us are missing these priceless messages. Everything in this book is meant from the perspective of being prayed, so our ability to hear God speak to us is invaluable. We are not praying formulas, but rather as led by the Holy Spirit, supported by an ever-deepening understanding of the Way of God.

The key to successful listening is being baptized in the Holy Spirit ([[Acts 1_5\| Acts 1:5]], [[Romans 8_10\| Rom. 8:10]]) and having an ever-shrinking list of things that distract us from hearing. As the world’s demand for convenience grows, the list of distractions in our lives is rising like a rocket. As with all things, we must deal with modern conveniences using great wisdom. Two key examples are the television set and the internet-ready computer. The goal of the enemy is to rob us of time with our God, and that makes us ineffective children. We start to win the war when more of our time is spent soaking in the Presence of our Father.

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Him who is the Head, that is, Christ.” [[Ephesians 4_14-15 \| Ephesians 4:14-15]]* #bible-verse #holy-spirit #His-will #wisdom #maturity 

Mature children know to only listen to their Father’s report. When the Israelites were about to enter the land Canaan that was promised by God, Moses sent spies to ascertain the lay of the land. They brought back good news; the land was full of milk and honey. They also brought back an evil report; the land was full of giants that needed to be conquered before they could take it. To the demise of that generation, they listened to the evil report and faltered. They should have listened to neither. The only thing that mattered was that God promised the land.

### Responsible

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.” [[Proverbs 18_21 \|Proverbs 18:21]]* #bible-verse 

The Father is sending us off as His Representatives. We carry His authority with us as His Children. Mature sons and daughters of the King know that their words have great power. It is imperative that we speak out the Truth that God speaks to our hearts and nothing else. We have been given great authority through the Holy Spirit and great power through the Blood of Jesus. The Lord is teaching us daily to make us mature in Him so we can be good stewards of this. It should never be taken lightly. #truth #holy-spirit #heaven #steward #legacy #trust #authority 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” [[Matthew 16_19\| Matthew 16:19]]* #bible-verse 

Sons and daughters with strength of character do not allow evil words to leave their mouths. There is a concept in American vernacular today known as “venting,” which is short for ventilation or, the release of something that has been contained under pressure (my definition). More specifically, “spewing words of frustration about how the actions of a person affected MY agenda.” This is fruit of demonic lies that try to get us to judge the actions of another person. Over time, it builds up within us with great pressure. The enemy wants to get us to speak this out in a public setting to destroy our credibility or to cause an offense in another person. “Venting” has no purpose in the Kingdom of God (See  [[Matthew 12_33-37 \|Matt. 12:33-37]]). It is a good example of how we have been misled into using the power God gave us for ill. #bible-verse #selfishness #self-sourcing #self-protection 

##### Kingdom Focused

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within you.’” [[Luke 17_20-21 \| Luke 17:20-21]]

Our Father is not just a wealthy and powerful man, He is the King. That makes us princes and princesses. His Kingdom exists now, it does not begin when we die or a thousand years from now. It began at Calvary. God placed all things under the feet of Christ and appointed Him the Head over all things for the church when He raised Christ from the dead ([[Ephesians 1_20-22\| Eph. 1:20-22]]). We are citizens of this Kingdom ([[Ephesians 2_19\|Eph. 2:19]]) in heaven ([[Philippians 3_20 \| Phil. 3:20]]), sitting together in Christ, now ([[Ephesians 2_6\|Eph. 2:6]]). As sons and daughters of the King ([[Galatians 4_7\|Gal. 4:7]]), we are privy to the Master’s business ([[John 15_15\| John 15:15]]) and have purpose in it: to go and feed His sheep in all nations ([[Matthew 28_18-20 \| Matt. 28:18-20]].) This is His priority ([[John 21_15-17 \|John 21:15-17]]), especially for the least of His brothers ([[Matthew 25_40 \| Matt. 25:40]]). #bible-verse #birthright #inheritance 


The Father wants to teach us to become men and women of character. The fruit of this is love. By spending intimate time with Him, we learn to hear His voice and grow closer to Him. It is here in this place that God reveals the mysteries of His Heart to us. True joy is being in the Presence of the Lord. *“You have made known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.”* [[Psalm 16_11\|Ps. 16:11]]  #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>“But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.” [[Tapestry/Bible/1 Peter/1 Peter 2_9\|1 Peter 2:9]] #bible-verse 

A **royal priest ** is a son of man (human), filled with the Holy Spirit, and commissioned by the King of Kings, Jesus Christ. The Lamb that was slain redeemed us to God and made us to have the authority to rule a kingdom and to be priests that reign on the earth ( [[Revelation 5_9-10\|Rev. 5:9-10]]). As priests, we prepare the environment in advance of God’s coming, usher in His Presence, and minister to His Heart through praise and worship. As kings, we move with the authority of the High King to defeat the enemies of God and establish His Will on the earth. This combination of privileges defines our Kingdom identity and destiny. #bible-verse #love #heart-of-God #intimacy #royal-priest #His-will #destiny

### Mission

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.” [[John 14_12 \|John 14:12]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus emulated for us everything we will do on this mission. He brought Light and Truth everywhere He went. He healed the sick, raised the dead, performed miracles and supernatural signs and wonders. He Loved. His Blood empowers us and His Holy Spirit authorizes us to do the same and more.

This Father knows what the marauders are doing to His daughter. He knows that she is kept in a cage in the dark where she has been beaten, cursed at, raped, sold into prostitution, and made to do, consume, and witness unthinkable things. He realizes that the mission to get her back is urgent. It cannot wait another day. He needs His other children to find her, bring Light to her, and get her home where she can be healed and renewed. #rescue #destiny #restoration #light-of-jesus 

Terraforming is a strategy for the sons and daughters to transform the environment around them to the culture of their Father’s Kingdom, and to get their sister back. It comes from the storehouses of the Father: it is His wisdom for bringing Light to the dark places. Even those children who have been delayed by the tactics of the marauders or their emissaries will be able to get themselves back on track. It is His wisdom for moving with the authority we have inherited to wield His Power and conquer the marauders. It is the wisdom to bring our sister home to Daddy.

God wants us to trust Him and give Him everything. Then He can teach us to hear His voice and stay in the Truth ([[Matthew 13_23\| Matt 13:23]]), to stand on the foundation of Christ so trials and persecution will not knock us down ([[Matthew 13_20 \| Matt 13:20]]), and to learn love so we understand that God’s priorities are paramount and distractions of the world are worthless ([[Matthew 13_21\|Matt. 13:21]]). #bible-verse #trust #distraction 

Our hearts have changed. His priorities are now ours. It is with great honor that we bring our Father’s Kingdom to this land. But it is with passionate urgency that we rescue our sister. There is only a limited time allocated in all of eternity for this mission. We don’t plan to come home until we have her… #bible-verse #light #truth #storehouse #inheritance #trust #rescue #blood #terraforming

## Chapter 3: Definitions 
#chapter #kingdom #terraforming

> *“Then have them make a sanctuary for Me, and I will dwell among them.”  [[Exodus 25_8\|Exodus 25:8]]* #bible-verse

>*“Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?”*
>*[[1 Corinthians 3_16 \|1 Corinthians 3:16]]* #bible-verse 

Terraforming is a function of the royal priesthood to prepare creation (person, place, or thing) for the Presence and Glory of the Lord through the power of the Blood of Jesus and the authority of the Holy Spirit. Terraforming is also the act of changing the atmosphere in our homes, our work, our schools, and in the lives of our family, our friends, and even our enemies by defeating evil and establishing strongholds for the Kingdom of God. #relationship 

The word Terraforming started as science fiction, but is currently viewed by scientists as being a lofty dream of how to colonize other planets in the future. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) defines Terraforming as “*transforming a hostile environment into one able to sustain human life*.” It is literally meant to take an alien world (Mars) and make it more like the world of origin (Earth). This book does not discuss the morality of space exploration, but rather uses the term as a picture of God’s strategy for His sons and daughters on earth. #royal-priest #terraforming #blood

Terraformers change conditions (atmospheres) to reform earth. Using “Terraforming” as a name for our Kingdom work is divinely inspired, but can also be seen as a play-on of words. Earth became hostile to the Kingdom of God at the fall of man in Genesis 3. And although the second Adam, our Lord Jesus Christ brought victory over death and hades , the Earth remains hostile to this day. We have been commissioned to bring the Will of the Lord to this world, making disciples of all men. As this happens, Earth becomes hospitable to the Kingdom of God, or Terraformed. #His-will  #kingdom  #terraforming 

### His Presence

>*“There, above the cover between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the Testimony, I will meet with you and give you all my commands for the Israelites.” [[Exodus 25_22 \| Exodus 25:22]]* #bible-verse 

God is everywhere ([[Psalm 139_7-8 \| Ps. 139:7-8]]). He has no beginning and no end. He is all-powerful ([[Luke 1_37\| Luke 1:37]]) and all knowing ([[Hebrews 4_13\|Heb. 4:13]]). That being said, God also chooses to dwell with His people in an intimate way. He gives us more of Him so we can detect His Presence, and receive from Him in a direct way. We receive revelation, healing, comfort, joy, and euphoria in this place of love and affection. We also give to Him as we minister to His Heart through our thanksgiving, praise, and worship. The Presence of the Lord is priceless and above all value. When David felt distant from It, he cried out for It (Psalm 13).  #heart-of-God #kingdom #royal-priest  #revelation

>*“You have made them to be a kingdom *[royal power to rule over a kingdom] *and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.” [[Revelation 5_10\|Revelation 5:10]]* #bible-verse

God is holy. There is no chance of Him doing evil. Before welcoming the Lord to dwell among us in this intimate setting, we must prepare for Him as priests. This role includes washing the area of all evil so our Lord is not welcomed into an unholy environment. Terraforming is changing the environment of a person, place, or thing from unclean to clean, from evil to good. We destroy demonic strongholds and establish a stronghold for the Kingdom of God.

### Terraforming Outline

Any person, place, or thing is Terraformed when we pray over them. The first part of this prayer is asking the Father to shine the **Light of Jesus **that reveals all impurities, contaminants, or pollutants. Most impurities are sin or the effects of sin, usually in the form of legal rights for the “devil and his angels” ([[Matthew 25_41\| Matt. 25:41]]) to torment, afflict, or interfere with the work of the Kingdom of God on Earth. The second step is when these are washed clean by the **Blood of Jesus **and the word of the testimony. This is a prayer of forgiveness for the person or the people whose sins resulted in the contamination of the place or thing. It includes speaking out the effects of the Blood on that person to testify against the accuser. The third step is when any effects or remnants of evil are removed with the **Authority that Jesus gave to us **through the Holy Spirit. We are careful to stand in agreement with all blessings that the Father has spoken into them since before they were born. #terraforming #light #jesus #prayer #bible-verse #blood #holy-spirit #forgiveness 


##### People

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Who may ascend into the hill of the LORD? Or who may stand in His holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart…” [[Psalm 24_3-4a\| Psalm 24:3-4a]]* #bible-verse

God was clear in His instructions to the Israelites that they were to be clean before entering His presence or witnessing His move. The people of God were commanded to wash their clothes before the cloud came to them to demonstrate the Fire / power of God just prior to the giving of the Ten Commandments ([[Exodus 19_10 \|Ex. 19:10]]). #bible-verse 

Before allowing His priests to enter the Tent of Meeting, God instructed Aaron and his sons to be washed and become physically clean ([[Exodus 29_4\| Ex. 29:4]]) and then to have the blood of sacrificed animals sprinkled on them to become spiritually clean ([[Exodus 29_21\| Ex. 29:21]]). #bible-verse

This was reiterated over and again as critical, with death as the consequence of disobedience. Before the Israelites crossed the Jordan River into the promise land, Joshua had them consecrate themselves. It is God’s will for His people to be clean before entering His Presence. It was never an issue of whether they were His people or not. They were. The issue was purity.

One example of Terraforming a person is when you are about to pray for them face-to-face. It is important to understand that praying for someone should be a time for that person to experience the Presence of God. Simultaneously, as the one praying, you can be listening to the Holy Spirit for guidance on how the Father wants you to pray. As such, you will want to be able to hear the Lord speak and not the enemy. You also want the person you are praying for to hear the truth in your message, and not the distorted version. Satan wants to interfere with all Kingdom work happening on earth. His objective is to steal, kill, and destroy ([[John 10_10 \| John 10:10]]). Terraforming is the process of removing him from the equation. #bible-verse #prayer #holy-spirit #terraforming 

Many times we pray for people that are not in the room with us while we are praying, but will be at the time of the event you are preparing for. These can include family members, friends, enemies ([[Matthew 5_44\| Matt. 5:44]]), and complete strangers. We always ask the Lord to soften their hearts and open their minds to the Will of the Father. This is accomplished when we take the time to prepare ourselves and the person as the Lord has instructed us, with His Light, His Blood, and His Authority. #prayer #light #blood #heart #bible-verse #kingdom #terraforming 

### Places

> [!quote]+ 
>*“And so they will cleanse the land.” [[Ezekiel 39_16\| Ezekiel 39:16]]* #bible-verse 

God has also referred to the cleansing of the land. This can be seen when God speaks through the prophet Ezekiel about the future downfall of Gog, probably the king of Magog – a land north of the Black Sea and east of the Aral Sea. After God draws the armies of Magog to the mountains of Israel, He slaughters them there. God tells His people to bury the dead to cleanse the land. It is critical to recognize the significance of what God is saying here.

The exposed corpses of God’s fallen enemies will rot with bacteria, and also with demons that have legal rights to fester. This could result in a plague that would infect the Israelites and interfere with God’s work in their lives. Because of this, the land is unclean. #legal-right 

The Lord repeats this when He tells the Israelites to hunt for any trace of exposed bones. These are to be buried to cleanse the land. The legal right of the demons to fester in the exposed bones of God’s enemies could bring long-term calamity that would harm God’s people. To protect them and His work in their lives, God commands them to bury the bones. By completing the death of God’s enemies through proper burial, God’s people were protected. This is a picture for us today of how thorough this cleaning needs to be – and that can be accomplished only with the Blood of Jesus.

“Places” are where Kingdom work is accomplished; therefore we must bring God’s Will in advance of, and in support of our work. These “places” can include large areas such as the city we live in. It also includes the land under our house, our church, our ministry, our workplace, and the grocery stores, gas stations, and shopping malls we visit. In short, you can Terraform any place on the planet! #His-will #terraforming 

If there are two examples that people find to be the most useful, it would be Terraforming your house and your church / ministry. Your house is where you rest, recuperate, and where many people raise their children. Portals exist in almost every American home that can allow the evil one access including the TV, the phone, and the computer. Attacks are easy to identify: when that sense of agitation, unrest, or any temptation of sin invades our home. It is similar at church where new Christians are being taught as disciples, and mature Christians are being prepared to launch into their field of harvest. If you see signs of the accuser at work: lies, division, or destruction, it is time to Terraform. #discernment #light-of-jesus #terraforming 

Many intercessors are familiar with the concept of a “walk through.” This is where we prepare a building before an event (temporary residence), before moving in (new permanent residence), or even to go back and clean something up (existing

permanent residence). This is both an offensive and a defensive strategy for preparing a place for the Kingdom work that will happen there.

Another excellent example is a hotel room. We advise that you do not sleep in a hotel room until you have thoroughly Terraformed every corner, but especially the bed. When I traveled for business before knowing this, I had all kinds of trouble. The most common attacks are sickness and temptations of sexual sin and chemical abuse. Almost every hotel room in America has in-room television with pay-per-view movies, which include “adult” titles and horror films filled with violence. The acceptance of these things gives rights to the enemy in the room that must be dealt with before Kingdom citizens sleep there! #intercession #intercessor #terraforming #kingdom 


### Things

> [!quote]+ 
>*"See!" he said to all the people. "This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the LORD has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God." [[Joshua 24_27\| Joshua 24:27]]* #bible-verse 

The stone *heard *all the words that the Lord said??? How is this possible? Joshua demonstrates in this verse that matter has God- given memory and testifies to the words of the Lord. So too, our words, actions, and choices remain as a testimony that will either be for us or against us ([[Matthew 12_36-37\| Matt. 12:36-37]]). If a person commits a sin in a room, the materials in that room will remember the sin. These include the wood in the floor or furniture, the paint on the walls, and the metals in the fixtures. When entering this room for Kingdom work, these memories must be washed, or erased, through forgiveness with the Blood of Jesus. #bible-verse #forgiveness #terraforming 

Other examples include cars, roads, houses, lamps, sofas, and jewelry such as rings, watches, necklaces, and even false teeth. The list of “things” can be so extensive, that you can easily give in to fear and get bogged down trying to pray over every little detail. The best approach is to once again, listen to the Holy Spirit to lead you to what item is producing the right of the enemy to torment and afflict, and focusing on those things to Terraform.

The objective of Terraforming is to remove all interference by the enemy and to establish the Will of God. It is the complete package of preparation: identifying hidden obstacles with the Light, detaching them with the Blood, and dislodging them with the Authority of Jesus. Once this process is complete, the atmosphere of the person, place, or thing will change immediately. There has been a shift from the darkness to the Light, and it is powerful. #bible-verse  #terraforming #holy-spirit #blood #His-will #light #testimony #forgiveness 

Terraforming always ends in welcoming the Presence of the Lord and worshipping Him. This can be music, singing, dancing, motion, or words of adoration. Although Terraforming itself is a prayer, it is always the preparation, or introduction to another prayer. And as our Lord Jesus taught us, prayer always begins with worship. *“Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name….” [[Matthew 6_9\| Matthew 6:9]]* #bible-verse 

The Lord is holy. He wants us to be clean before entering His presence. He does not want impurities in our hearts, or in the things that surround us, or even in the land we stand upon. His instructions were given when the Israelites built the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting. These instructions were made perfect in the new covenant ([[Jeremiah 31_31 \| Jere. 31:31]], [[Luke 22_20\| Luke 22:20]]), that through the Blood of Jesus we have the power to erase the unholy past of our lives so we can stand free in the present. With these contaminants removed, we will see victory in our lives for the Kingdom purposes to which we have been called ([[Philippians 3_12\| Phil. 3:12]]). #bible-verse #terraforming #authority #prayer #worship #kingdom #purpose

## Chapter 4: The Light of Jesus
#light-of-jesus

> [!quote]+ 
>*“You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the Light of Your Presence.”* *[[Psalm 90_8\| Psalm 90:8]]* #bible-verse 
>
>*“I am the Light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness, but will have the Light of life.” [[John 8_12b\| John 8:12b]]* #bible-verse 

Light is just not a good thing for the devil. When the foundation of your power is in your success as a liar, light is entirely inconvenient. Since Jesus took the keys of death and hades away, where does satan’s power come from? It comes from the choices and actions of the men and women on this earth that are created in the image of God. Being in His image, we have the power to choose, the power to create or destroy, the power to make judgments, and the power to forgive. And to get those choices to go his way, satan lies. If the lie is believed, he steals ( [[Matthew 13_19\|Matt. 13:19]]). And once he has stolen from us, he has power to kill and destroy ([[John 10_10\|John 10:10]]). #light-of-jesus #bible-verse #power 

It is a nasty crime. First, he comes as a wolf in sheep’s clothing, talking sweetly to us and convincing us to make poor choices. Once we’ve acted upon these, the accuser comes back with condemnation and guilt. Shame is next on the menu. The enemy wants us to hide in the dark with him. If we choose to sin, accept condemnation, and then hide our sin in the darkness we have willingly given power to the enemy to place us in prison for our crime. #choice

In every sense this goes against all that Jesus bought and paid for at a very high price. The most horrific part of this story is that most people, including many Christians, sit in these prisons on this very day. But there is good news (gospel). God has empowered His children to go and get them out. #choice #image #shame #guilt #dark #jesus 

### REVELATION

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock *[of revelation] *I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.” [[Matthew 16_17-18\|Matthew 16:17-18]]* #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through the revelation of Jesus Christ.” [[Galatians 1_11-12\|Galatians 1:11-12]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus spoke of revelation from the Father as being the foundation of His church. Paul experienced this firsthand as the wealth of understanding that was within him could only be attributed to revelation. This revelation comes from seeing and hearing the Truth as God speaks it into our hearts. The Lord wants to reveal to us all that is in our hearts, including all evil ([[Matthew 12_34\|Matt. 12:34]]), so we can be purified by the Blood of Jesus and made free. Our sins were never meant to be a secret, either from us or from our siblings in Christ ([[James 5_16\|James 5:16]]). *“But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin.” [[1 John 1_7\|1 John 1:7]]* #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“No more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the LORD.” [[Jeremiah 31_34a\| Jeremiah 31:34a]]* #bible-verse 

God’s decision to demonstrate His power through revelation is wondrous to behold. No matter where you are or in what state of being you find yourself, God is able to miraculously reach you through revelation. It is His way of calling to the lost, no matter where they are. He can do this. He is God.

I know of examples where God has supernaturally healed children stricken with disease that greatly impaired their mind and body. They have spoken clearly about what God said to them while they were sick. This says to me that there is no prison that can separate us from our Lord and Savior. God is merciful in His love for us. He knows His children and does not forsake them ever ([[Isaiah 41_17\|Isa 41:17]]). #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.” [[1 Corinthians 2_9\|1 Corinthians 2:9]] / [[Isaiah 64_4 \| Isaiah 64:4]]* #bible-verse 

### TRUTH

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”  [[John 8_31-32\|John 8:31-32]]* #bible-verse

When we follow the Truth, we never walk in darkness. The lie says that if we are discovered, we will endure punishment or ramifications that will imprison us. As such, we should avoid the consequences by hiding what we’ve done. The lie wants us to have a worldly mentality that misses eternity. The Truth is that Jesus paid for all eternal punishment and consequence. Even if our actions on earth require physical punishment now (the imprisoned criminal that has just received the Lord), the eternal Truth is that we have been set free in Christ Jesus ([[Hebrews 9_15 \|Heb. 9:15]]). Our life on earth is a dot next to eternity in Heaven. The enemy does not want us to remember this. #bible-verse 

Jesus said that HE IS the Light ([[John 8_12\| John 8:12]]), the Truth, and the Way ([[John 14_6\| John 14:6]]). The freedom that Christ brought us is in being able to live according to God’s Standard and not the world’s standard. The world says that you must build treasures here on earth to be of value. These include good looks (no fat, all muscle, proportionate, etc), wealth, religiously admirable (in some cultures), or in other words, without flaw. God’s standard says that we are wonderfully made ([[Psalm 139_14\|Ps. 139:14]]) and can lay our treasures in heaven where moth, rust, and thieves cannot take them ([[Matthew 6_19 \|Matt. 6:19]]). The Truth is that we are eternal beings. The liar does not want us to live this way.  #freedom #truth #jesus #heaven #treasure #light #heart-of-God #bible-verse

### HIDDEN SINS

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'” [[Acts 26_17b-18\|Acts 26:17b-18]]* #bible-verse 

The enemy likes hidden sins. As long as the sins remains hidden, it cannot be dealt with through forgiveness. Satan does not want to lose any power and therefore is extremely motivated to keep the existence of sins in the dark. This can be through generational sins of forefathers long gone, or the sins that we have received shame for and have freely chosen to hide in the dark to prevent exposure. Our decision to place these sins in the Light of His Presence or to submit to His spirit of revelation, will greatly weaken the power of the enemy. #hidden #darkness #light 

When we began praying for people in Tulsa, we had amazing results for close to a year. But eventually we began to notice that with some people we reached a plateau over a period of time where the breakthroughs stopped. One day the Lord said to us, “*Ask Me to shine My Light on them*.” This was a foreign concept to us, but we gave it a try. We were dumbfounded. The person that we were praying for was someone we had been praying with for nearly a year. They were at one of these plateaus and not much had happened in some time.

As soon as we prayed in the Light, that person began to speak out to us many sins (committed by them and trespassed against them) that we had never heard before! It was as if a valve had been turned and the dam released. Over the next few weeks that person’s entire family was healed as a result of these confessions. The entire experience was wonderful for all and nothing short of a miracle for the person we were praying for. That same day we prayed for several other people with the same results. God was showing us that His Light brought things to the surface that needed to be released for a person to be set free. They were sins that the evil one was using as a right to torment and afflict these people. #forgiveness #terraforming #light #alignment #prayer #interceding #revelation #choice #invitation

### DAILY BREAD

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Give us today our daily bread.” [[Matthew 6_11\| Matthew 6:11]]* #bible-verse 

The next thing the Lord showed us was that the Light would reveal ALL hidden sins. This sounds like a good thing, but turned out to be overwhelming. There were so many sins being presented that we were unable to deal with them all before the person being prayed for was exhausted. The Lord showed us that there is a perfect sequence and a safe quantity that He knows to work in. We just need to yield to Him so we can receive it. #light-of-jesus #hidden #revelation #trust 

The Lord showed us to ask that He give that person their daily bread of His will done, which includes revelation, healing, and inheritance. By doing so, we are submitting to His process of freedom. This way the person being prayed for is not overwhelmed by too many revelations, nor short-changed by too little. They are also able to see the perfect efficiency of the Lord’s process whereby those things that must be dealt with first before others can be dealt with are handled accordingly. #daily-bread #His-will #freedom 

This is paramount to our lives in Christ. We must understand that God is “juggling” six and a half billion people created in His image with freewill. Each one of us makes countless decisions each day that affect much in creation. Because of this, we must trust Him to lead us to what is right in His perfect sequence, quantity, and timing. The Lord wants to sanctify us and set us free, but He knows the best way for this to happen. If we will yield to His daily allocation (our daily bread), we will see mighty things accomplished in our lives. #creation #daily-bread #prayer 


### TERRAFORMING WITH THE LIGHT

Terraformers ask the Lord to shine the Light of Jesus over, in, and through the person, place, or thing being prepared. We pray that the Light would cover the darkness and that there would be no shadows. The Light pours in through every crack and every crevice into the deepest places. We knock the lids off of any hiding places that the Light would rush in, revealing all secret sins and iniquities.

As led by the Holy Spirit, we sometimes ask that our Lord Jesus, Lion of the Tribe of Judah ([[Revelation 5_5\| Rev. 5:5]]) would come and prowl in that person’s life. The Lion will reveal all impurities in His Light as He roars at the darkness, shaking the house so everything that is not of Him will crumble ([[Hebrews 12_25-29\|Heb. 12:25-29]]). He pants in the ear of those that He loves, whispering all that is revealed in the Light. The Lord wants to see lives changed with the Truth (set the captives free), and when He comes, the Truth is made known. #bible-verse #light #reveal #truth 

If the heart of the person is soft, the fruit of the Truth will be confession. This should result in one or more reactions: repentance of sins, forgiveness of those that have trespassed against them, and obedience to God (changing your “no” to “yes”). Each circumstance will be different, but within all captivity is the need to do one or more of these things to be made truly free. #light #truth #trust #forgiveness #His-will 

We want to avoid “prophetic haywire” whereby we see or hear all things in the Spirit, many of which are not meant to be spoken-out at the time of your prayer. The Light will filter these things through daily bread and highlight only those that need to be dealt with now. When we pray, we need to be able to see things as God sees them. We want to operate within His Will. The Light will reveal these things to us. #holy-spirit #jesus #truth #light #forgiveness #prayer #daily-bread #His-will

## Chapter 5: The Blood of Jesus
#chapter #blood #jesus #heaven #priest 

> [!quote]+ 
>*[Christ] did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once and for all by His own Blood, having obtained eternal redemption. [[Hebrews 9_12\| Hebrews 9:12]]* #bible-verse 
>
>*“Jesus answered, ‘A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean.’ [[John 13_10\| John 13:10]]* #bible-verse 

It is difficult to fathom the power of the Blood of Jesus. It is above all history, actions, and deeds. The Blood impacts reality both on Earth and in Heaven. All of the requirements for entering the Presence of God are met with the Blood. Instead of cleansing ourselves through the sacrifice of animals, we can receive the Blood of Jesus and be totally clean. Instead of washing our hands and feet at the laver ([[Exodus 40_30-31\|Ex. 40:30-31]]), we are washed by the Blood. When we first believed, God gave our entire body a bath by crucifying our sinful nature ([[Galatians 5_24\|Gal. 5:24]]). From that day forward ([[Luke 9_23\|Luke 9:23]]), we must continue to diligently wash our feet ([[John 13_10\|John 13:10]]), that is, be cleansed of the daily impurities that get on us. In Terraforming, that means preparing our lives as priests by washing with the Blood of Jesus every day. #bible-verse

##### SIN

> [!quote]+
> *"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' [[Matthew 7_21-23\|Matthew 7:21-23]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus gave us the definition of sin. It is simply put, doing anything outside of the Will of the Father. We can narrow this down to the word ‘disobedience,’ but not without clarification. Moses captured God’s Will in the written law. Prophets from Samuel to Malachi and on to the present time have spoken God’s Will to us. The Apostles wrote His Will in their letters to the brethren. The Lord speaks His Will to us in our hearts as we mature in Him, we begin to hear His Voice and respond to it. When we choose anything that is outside of Him, we have sinned. #sin #His-will 

Sin separates us from God. With all that is at stake (see [[Matthew 3_12,25-41\|Matt. 3:12, 25:41]], and [[Luke 16_19-31\|Luke 16:19-31]] for details), we cannot accept anything less than complete redemption from our sin, especially when it is offered by God and came at a terrible price. What happens when we sin against God and commit a trespass against our neighbor? We suffer consequences such as deception, division, destruction, and death. The power of sin results in torment and affliction and also opens the door to other sins. Sin provides the legal right for the enemy to torment and afflict. The Blood of Jesus provides the legal right for God’s people to be free. #bible-verse #legal-right #blood-of-Jesus #freedom #rescue 

The Blood of Jesus is the literal representation of the new covenant with the Lord  ([[Luke 22_20\|Luke 22:20]]). Through it we are all saved, both Jew and Gentile alike ([[Romans 1_16 \|Rom. 1:16]]). For the Gentiles, this is a radical change in circumstances. Once we were born despised by our own Creator, now we are born again as sons and daughters with an inheritance of the eternal Kingdom. #bible-verse

Jesus Christ paid this price for us, that by His body that was bruised, we are healed. By His Blood we are saved from being eternally separated from Love, and from being cast into a lake of burning sulfur for ever and ever  ([[Revelation 21_8\|Rev. 21:8]]). #bible-verse #blood #jesus #heaven #priest 

The Blood also provides us with freedom in our lives here on earth. Jesus referred to this time as a harvest ([[Matthew 9_37-38\|Matthew 9:37-38]]) where seeds are planted in the hearts of people and the children of God are called as His servants for the work of reaping. For this work, we must be free, that is, healed from all iniquity in our bodies, our minds, and our souls. In chapter four we learned that the Light reveals the Truth and it is the Truth that sets us free. We stay free with the Blood of Jesus. We see this manifest through three properties of the Blood: purification, redemption, and restoration.

### PURIFICATION

> [!quote]+ 
>*“But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin.” [[1 John 1_7\|1 John 1:7]]* #bible-verse 

Purification is the process of ridding someone of anything harmful, such as sin. Sin represents both the exterior dirt that Aaron and his sons washed from their hands in [[Exodus 29_4\|Ex. 29:4]], and also the inner impurity that required the blood of goats. As being clean is a prerequisite of receiving the Presence of the Lord as He intends for us to, purification is a critical objective of Terraforming. Only the Blood of Jesus can do this for us. What a privilege to have this priceless gift from our God! #bible-verse #terraforming #purification #blood #jesus #light #redemption #restoration #sin 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.” [[Jeremiah 31_34c \| Jeremiah 31:34c]]* #bible-verse 

There is power in the memory of sin. In our minds it manifests as regret, shame, fear, anger, hurt, bitterness, grief, sorrow, and pain. In the spiritual realm, it serves as a legal right for the evil one to torment and afflict us. To be free from this torment, we must be washed with the Blood of Jesus. Here the power of the Blood once again astounds us. #blood-of-Jesus

<p style="text-align:center;">

We are washed so clean, it is as if the history has been rewritten and the sin never occurred in the first place. God will remember our sins no more. He has no memory of it. God is God. When God doesn’t remember something, it isn’t denial. It is because that thing doesn’t exist anymore, not even in His memory!  #restoration  #legal-right #blood #jesus #sin #shame #fear #grief #purification #grace 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.”[[Psalm 103_12 \|Psalm 103:12]]* #bible-verse 

This is a reason for great celebration. The Truth, who is Christ Jesus, truly did set us free. His Blood bought us separation from our sin so that the power of the sin is broken and we can now die to the sin ([[Colossians 3_5\|Col. 3:5]]) for good. Abstaining from sin is futile effort without the Blood of Jesus. With the power of sin intact, the evil one comes with temptation that is nearly impossible to resist for long. With the power broken, it is like breaking a habit you haven’t formed yet. It is like quitting something that is addicting, when you’ve never been addicted to it. The addiction / habit are removed so that you feel like you never had them in the first place. Praise be to our Lord for setting us free indeed! #bible-verse #truth #jesus #temptation #blood #freedom  

### REDEMPTION

> [!quote]+ 
>*“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace.” [[Ephesians 1_7 \|Ephesians 1:7]]* #bible-verse 

Redemption can be defined as the removal of an obligation such as a debt, or in this case, the consequence of sin, which is death ([[Romans 6_23\|Rom. 6:23]]). Using “deliverance” as a synonym, we can refer to redemption as being rescued from captivity, hardship, or domination by evil. The Blood of Jesus literally cancels the debt of sin while simultaneously freeing us from the legal right of satan to torment us and afflict us. The removal of these rights is critical to preparing us for the Presence of God. More will be discussed in the chapter, “The Authority of Jesus.” #redemption #rescue #blood #jesus #choice #sin #authority #generational-sins 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.”* [[1 Peter 1_18-19\|1 Pet. 1:18-19]]*

Not all of the power of sin that inflicts us is the result of choices that we made. Some are inherited. The Lord *“punishes the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation ([[Numbers 14_18\|Num. 14:18]]).” *Your sins can be passed to your children, your grandchildren, and your great-grandchildren. It is possible to be suffering right now from an affliction that is claimed as a right by the enemy due to the actions of these distant relatives, or forefathers. The rights are stripped by the Blood of Jesus. Terraforming a person must always include dealing with the sins of our forefathers to ensure that these rights do not result in impurities that will limit the Presence of God.

### RESTORATION

> [!quote]+
> *“But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.” [[Ephesians 2_13\|Ephesians 2:13]]* #bible-verse

Restoration can be defined as returning something to a former condition, in this case, back to a right relationship with God. While sin separates us from God, we are reconciled in Christ through His mighty Blood. When praying for a place such as your house, the Blood of Jesus restores the land to its condition prior to being defiled by the sins of the people that have been there. Restoration also includes returning the person to the state that God designed them to be in before they were born. God has an identity that He has chosen for us when He created us ([[Ephesians 1_11\|Eph. 1:11]]). It starts with us as sons and daughters of the King with an inheritance. It ends with the specific role that we play in the body of Christ. We walk into this identity through the reconciliation and restoration power of the Blood of Jesus. #blood-of-Jesus #restoration #sin #reconciliation #defilement #identity #design #inheritance #purification #return #repentance #forgiveness #cleansing

The end result of receiving the Blood of Jesus is that we are presented holy and blameless before the Lord. We are ready to eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord in a worthy manner as we are now in a right relationship with God ([[1 Corinthians 11_27\|1 Cor 11:27]]). #bible-verse #restoration #relationship #blood-of-Jesus  #jesus #communion #inheritance #purification 

### TERRAFORMING WITH THE BLOOD

God wants us to be clean before entering His Presence. In the Old Testament, this was accomplished by a laver ([[Exodus 29_4\|Ex. 29:4]]) and through the blood of animals ([[Exodus 29_21\|Ex. 29:21]]). In the New Covenant, Jesus washes our entire body when we first come to Him. But on a daily bases, we need to have our feet washed. Jesus knows that we will sin, maybe not intentionally, but it will happen. Just as the feet will get dirty from walking in Israel with sandals on, we will get dirty from walking in this world. He and only He can wash us clean.

How do you nullify an accusation in a courtroom? The answer is simple, to be found “not guilty” of the crime. How then do those who are guilty cast down the accuser? The accuser (plaintiff) stands before God (Judge) in the throne room (courtroom) and points out the sins (offenses) of mankind (defendant) day and night. His objective is to present the times that we truly fell short of the glory of God, thus giving satan power or the “right to manifest on earth.”

So if mankind is guilty of these sins, how is this accusation hurled down? The only way is through the forgiveness provided by the Blood of Jesus. It is as if our history is re-written and we never committed the crime in the first place. Complete freedom on earth is then found through the word of our testimony. This testimony includes speaking out each of the properties of being forgiven by the Blood of Jesus (Purification, Redemption, #guilt #accuser #redemption #freedom #forgiveness #testimony #purification

Restoration) as led by the Holy Spirit. This triggers the Fullness of Forgiveness, and it is found in [[Revelation 12_10-11\|Revelation 12:10-11]]. #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Let the redeemed of the LORD say this—those he redeemed from the hand of the foe...” [[Psalm 107_2\|Psalm 107:2]]*  #bible-verse 

You can’t imagine how desperately the evil one wants you to NOT know this. He will do anything to keep you from praying this way for he knows what happens to him when we do (he is hurled down). His first tactic is to keep you from the Blood of Jesus. It is critical to understand that all forgiveness must come from the power of the Blood of Jesus. This is true because nothing else can change you from “guilty” to “not guilty.” We must go to Jesus to be washed clean.

The second tactic of the evil one is to keep us from praying the word of the testimony when we give or receive forgiveness. That is, the spoken word (*logos *in Greek) that testifies (*marturia *in the Greek) to what God has done. Remember, our words have power ([[Proverbs 18_21\|Prov. 18:21]]) and it is important that we take the time to speak out what the Lord leads us to say. In a courtroom there are no assumptions or implied arguments, we must testify to what the Lord bought for us. What happens when we give / receive what the Lord bought for us with the Blood of Jesus? We are purified of all contamination. We are redeemed of all debts. The Lord remembers our sins no more ([[Jeremiah 31_34\|Jere. 31:34]]) and it is therefore as if our history has been re-written. All trace of our sin is erased. We are then restored to the men and women of God we were created to be. We are holy and blameless in His sight. This is the testimony of our forgiveness. #bible-verse  #logos  #marturia #greek

We must speak these things out to fully cast down the accuser, and he does not want you to do this. Beware of his attempts to keep you from speaking out his demise. He might offer you shortcuts in prayer to save time, tempt you with laziness, or even falsely accuse you of “praying like the heathen ([[Matthew 6_7\|Matt. 6:7]])” when you speak out what the Holy Spirit leads you to say. Be bold and courageous! When we Terraform a person (including ourselves) we must remove all rights of the accuser to torment and afflict. This is part of the “foul atmosphere” we are changing in the process. The Blood of the Lamb and the word of the testimony are keys to this. #bible-verse #holy-spirit #blood #terraforming #testimony #accuser

>*“...without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.” [[Hebrews 9_22b\|Hebrews 9:22b]]* #bible-verse 

Many Christians believe that only Jesus can forgive sins. The truth in this is that all forgiveness must come from the Blood of Jesus as its source. The two are inseparable; without the Blood, there is no true forgiveness. Ever since Jesus uttered the words, “It is finished!” ([[John 19_30\|John 19:30]]) and gave up His Spirit, the power of forgiveness has been continuously offered by the Lord through the Blood of Jesus. We only have to receive it. #bible-verse #blood-of-Jesus 

When Jesus gave it to us, the authority to forgive has come from the Holy Spirit within us ([[John 20_22-23\|John 20:22-23]]). We are authorized, commissioned, and commanded to carry forgiveness to the Body of Christ through the Blood of Jesus. Forgiveness is our priestly duty, right, and joy! As sons and daughters of the King, we are sent out to bring freedom to the world through the authority of the Holy Spirit and the power of the Blood of Jesus. We sprinkle the Blood over our brothers and sisters, breaking the power of sin, sickness, disease, pain, sorrow, and unresolved grief. We pray out the word of the testimony, speaking into their lives the truth that Christ bought them. We see them set free when the Light reveals the truth, and the Blood breaks the power of the evil one in their lives. This is love! #forgiveness #blood #holy-spirit #pray #light #truth #freedom #love

Quite frankly, this book could have been called “Forgiveness for the Kingdom” because it is the key to Terraforming. It is one of God’s “secret weapons” in his arsenal against the kingdom of darkness. It has been available to us for over 2000 years, but is just now being experienced in its fullness. As with many things in the Lord, the evil one comes to pervert the good things so as to rob us of its true power.

This is not to say that those who ask for forgiveness without speaking out the word of the testimony are not forgiven. God’s Grace is bigger than that! What it does mean is that God is teaching us how to be free so we can participate in the preparation of the Bride. With the rest of this chapter and the rest of this book, we will use this definition whenever the word “forgive” is used.

In every definition of “justice,” we earn punishment and consequence when we sin. It is both fair and reasonable to expect to receive “what’s coming to us” when we do what is unjust in the eyes of the Lord. We don’t deserve the forgiveness that we receive when we repent, yet we are forgiven. That forgiveness is too good to be true, but it is. It is the perfect Truth. How can we possibly withhold forgiveness from those who trespass against us?  #sin #forgiveness #truth #justice 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God…” [[Romans 3_23\|Romans 3:23]]* #bible-verse 


In light of this, we begin to understand how we want to be forgiven by God. The second greatest commandment is, *“You shall love your neighbor as yourself ([[Matthew 22_39\|Matt. 22:39]]).” *This is God’s version of empathy, which is a beautiful picture of love and selflessness. *“For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all ([[James 2_10\|James 2:10]]).” *When we realize that we are guilty of sin and that God views all sins as being the same, we cannot possibly refuse the fullness of forgiveness to another person. We deserve just punishment (death and hades) for our sins, yet God has forgiven us with the Blood of Jesus. We must do the same for our neighbors. See [[Matthew 18_21-35\|Matt. 18:21-35]]. #bible-verse 

Forgiveness is not the act of accepting an apology. There is no mention of apologies that I have found in the New Testament. You might accept their apology, but it is not a prerequisite to forgiving them. Forgiveness is not calling the trespass, “OK,” or acceptable. Forgiveness is also not joining a bowling league with the person unless they have repented. Jesus said to treat sinners who do not repent as *“a heathen and a tax collector. ([[Matthew 18_17\|Matt. 18:17]]).” *But this does not mean to withhold forgiveness. #bible-verse   #love #jesus #forgiveness #boundaries #sin #blood

>*“For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”* [[Matthew 7_2\|Matthew 7:2]]* #bible-verse 

How does God forgive our sins? He sent His only son into the world as a Lamb without blemish to be slain for our iniquities. We are now offered the free gift of receiving the Blood of Jesus to cleanse us of our sins. We should offer the same to those who trespass against us. In [[Matthew 6_12\|Matt. 6:12]], Jesus taught us to pray *“And forgive us our debts, AS WE forgive our debtors.” *In the Lord’s prayer, we ask God to forgive us in the same way we forgive others. How do you want the Lord to forgive you? The only answer can be with the unconditional sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus. #bible-verse 

We are therefore carriers of the Blood of Jesus for forgiveness in the Body of Christ. The Holy Spirit provides us with the authority to forgive and bring God’s Will on Earth. The power to forgive comes from the Blood. There is a theme throughout the New Testament of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is that we are forgiven by His Blood. This creates the clear definition that His forgiveness is the only true forgiveness, and we cannot recreate this in and of ourselves. It must come from Him. And Jesus told us that as He washed our feet, we are to go and do the same to others:

*“So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, ‘Do you know what I have done to you? You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am**. **If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet**. **For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.’”  [[John 13_12-17\|John 13:12–17]]* #bible-verse #blood #jesus #gift #pray #forgiveness #heart-of-God

Jesus forgave people who had not trespassed against Him. He did so at the leading of the Holy Spirit ([[John 6_38\|John 6:38]]). We will do the same. Some people struggle with the ramifications of this kind of forgiveness. Knowing the power of the Blood, they are deeply concerned about stripping the world of justice. It is critical that we understand whose role this is. We are not Judges of our brothers and sisters. That belongs to God alone. Our job is to forgive them with the same standard of measure that we want to be forgiven. Then let God take care of vengeance, justice, and judgment. #bible-verse #holy-spirit #judgment #justice #forgiveness 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.” [[Luke 6_37\|Luke 6:37]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus was very clear that there is a difference between judgement, condemnation, and forgiveness. His teaching was always based upon Love, which includes forgiveness. As a Hebrew, Jesus knew that blood is for the atonement ([[Leviticus 17_11\|Lev. 17:11]]) and that the two are inseparable ([[Hebrews 9_22\|Heb. 9:22]]). When Jesus used the word “forgive” He knew full well that one day the church would hurl down the accuser through forgiveness with His own Blood. #bible-verse

 powerful entity within us. The evil one uses this against us to bring temptation for sins that we have a history of committing, either from our own choices or those of our forefathers. This is the reason that many sins feel like addictions. It is nearly impossible to be set free. Praise be to Christ Jesus who bought our freedom!

To break the power of sin, simply apply forgiveness (offered or received) and cast down the accuser with the Blood of Jesus and the word of the testimony. Put the sin to death by killing the power and stripping the rights of the enemy to torment or afflict. The Truth has set us free, and we are free indeed! #choice #blood #addiction #truth #freedom #accuser 

It is important to note that forgiving others as a royal priest is a significant responsibility that should not be taken lightly. Remember that the person you are forgiving must repent and sin no more to keep power and authority from returning to the evil one. Our job is bring the forgiveness of Jesus at the leading of the Holy Spirit. The Lord will know when it is the right thing to do.

### SECOND KEY

“Power and authority are given to satan and his kingdom every time we freely choose to sin. Royal Priests strip the evil one of these rights by fully forgiving the people who sinned, sprinkling them with the Blood of the Lamb. We then hurl down the accuser with the word of our testimony, stating that the Blood of Jesus purifies, redeems and restores us to God.” #royal-priest #forgiveness #accuser #blood #jesus #rescue #redemption #kingdom #accuser #prayer

Status check: we have welcomed the Light of Jesus. All hidden evil, iniquities, and sins that the Lord wants us to deal with have been revealed. We have forgiven the people’s sins with the Blood of Jesus and the word of the testimony, canceling the rights of evil to fester. It is as if we have sprayed disinfectant cleaner on our bathtub to soak. The germs are now dead. They have lost all power of life to multiply, corrode, and stink. They have detached from the surface and are floating in a pool of the chemicals we have sprayed there. The last step is to scrub and wipe the scum away.

right to steal the seeds of life sown into us by our Lord ([[Matthew 13_19\|Matt. 13:19]]). He plants weeds in their place that produce fruit for the kingdom of darkness ([[Matthew 13_25\|Matt. 13:25]]). He captures prisoners of war through accusation, shame, and condemnation. He keeps them locked up in deep, dark cells, as far away from the Light of Truth as he can. #bible-verse #sin #legal-right #kingdom-of-darkness #seed #accusation #shame 

We have already won this war ([[John 19_30\|John 19:30]]). When the sons and daughters of the King come with the Light, the prisoners are rescued and set free. All rights of the evil one are stripped through forgiveness by the Blood of Jesus. Accusation is cast down with the word of the testimony. They overcome the power of the enemy with the authority given to them by Jesus through the Holy Spirit. They resist the devil and he flees from them. The stronghold of darkness is shattered. #truth #blood #holy-spirit #maturity #testimony #authority #sons-and-daughters #royal-priest

Next we remove all demons from the person, place, or thing by casting them out and commanding them to go under our feet. The Lord commanded Aaron and his sons to wash themselves physically and spiritually before entering His Presence. We are spiritually washed clean by the Blood of Jesus. Physical washing comes when we remove the demons that are symbolized by dirt, bacteria, and viruses that make our bodies impure. When this is accomplished, we are done. The bathtub is clean. #authority #purification #forgiveness #blood-of-Jesus  #demon

Jesus commanded demons not to ever return to the person he was freeing. He is teaching us that we have the authority to keep an unclean spirit from returning to the person that it has left. Our strategy for overcoming the power of the evil one is through forgiveness. When we forgive ([[Revelation 12_10-11\|Rev. 12:10-11]]), all rights of evil are stripped. The unclean spirit cannot return and bring "*with*

This throws the enemy into confusion as the demons that have been at work on this person or in this place are permanently removed. Remembering that sins are passed to the third and fourth generation ([[Numbers 14_18\|Num. 14:18]]), demons move from parent to child. They get experienced at tormenting us and learn our “push buttons.” They get good at tempting us. When those demons are commanded to *enter him no more*, the advantage moves to our side. When we then command the enemy camp to forget this experience and never use it again against anyone in our family, this experience is lost forever. It becomes more difficult to tempt the person as only new, less experienced demons can come back to tempt the person. Not only are we free, but we get the upper hand in the war! #bible-verse #generational-sins #demon #generational-forgiveness #freedom #restoration  #temptation

We have removed all demons from the person, place, or thing, but this does not mean that their influence is fully removed. Demons leave behind their excrement, their slime, and their seeds of evil that prevent cleanliness. The seeds are meant to grow and produce weeds that choke out the good wheat sown by our Father. All such impurities must be removed before they multiply like bacteria and begin to rot. This is critical to establish the clean environment that the Lord desires for His Presence. It is also a proactive strategy to prevent the long-term destruction of well-rooted, fruit-bearing implantations of evil. #demon #seed #purification

We welcome the Holy Spirit to come as of fire and sanctify the area by burning the impurities away. The fire consumes all power in what was left behind. We ask the Holy Spirit to come as of a rushing mighty wind and blow away the ashes. We welcome the Lord to come as water and carry away any remaining grime as with a flood. This completes the removal of any trace of evil. We have created an environment that is ceremonially clean for the Lord to come in.

Demons want to sneak into our lives through the gates and doors that the Lord has established. When we sin, they obtain the right to do this. Through forgiveness with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony, these rights are stripped. We can then declare that these gates are now off-limits to the enemy camp and that no demon may enter through them or spy on us from outside. #gate #legal-right #sin #forgiveness #blood #jesus

We have captured an enemy stronghold. In an aerial assault, the Blood of Jesus destroyed the power of the enemy. We must now convert the stronghold to one of ours.

The next step in Terraforming is to ask our Father for angels to support us. We do this as Jesus could have done in the garden of Gethsemane ([[Matthew 26_53\|Matt. 26:53]]). We set a perimeter around the outpost. We post sentry and sentinel angels at the gates or doors. We post guardian angels to each person and warring angels to fortify the stronghold. We establish a “demon-free zone” where no agents of evil may enter or obtain any information that can be used against the Kingdom of God. We place bindings in the angel’s hands and proclaim that all demons that interfere with the Will of the Father must be “left at the door.” We also welcome angels to minister to the hearts of the people that we will pray for. These we post just inside the entrance, after the sentry angels. This has a soothing effect on the people as they walk in the door. #bible-verse #angel #His-will #heart-of-God #terraforming  #authority

One time we posted both a sentry and sentinel angel outside of a hospital room after praying over it, forgiving the previous occupants with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. After we left the patient’s Pastor came to visit. Walking in with a wide open mouth and a white complexion, the Pastor said, “There are two of the tallest angels I’ve ever seen standing right outside of your door!” The patient was very excited to hear this, realizing that the pastor could not have known that we posted these. #prayer #community #spirit #blood-of-Jesus #angel #testimony #discernment

Another time we posted four warring angels around a building where we were holding a meeting. A man came and told us that he saw the angels at each corner of the property holding swords straight up into the sky! Where ever we go, we always ask the Lord about whether to establish a stronghold for the Kingdom of God through posting the angels He assigns us. The answer is usually, “yes!” and we do just that at His leading. #angel #authority #testimony

I myself, for example, have repented of an overindulgence in this game that resulted in fits of rage unbecoming of a pit bull with its nose hairs on fire. Much less a man of God. But there are several excellent analogies that you can glean from the sport, one of which I will notate here both to illustrate my point and to bring redemption to my previous personal admonishment.

Football has the greatest examples of “comebacks” in all of sports, as far as I am concerned. As a former (rehabilitated) maniacal fan, I could tell many a’ story of games that were lost until the last second, when, HEY! We won!!! There is excitement and fun (for most) when watching your team pull it together (finally), march down field (why couldn’t they have done that two quarters ago?), and score the points needed to win the game. But the lesson is not in what they did at the end. It is in what they could have done at the start of the game to avoid the need to catch up in the first place.

We are not on equal footing with the enemy of our God. We have advantage because Jesus Christ, the innocent Lamb, died for our sins and redeemed us. We have been called sons and daughters of the King and are now a royal priesthood, carrying

His Blood to bring forgiveness to the world, break the power of sin, and set the captives free. We have been given authority to change the atmosphere on earth from darkness to the Kingdom of God. We can do this now, in advance of trouble, not when we are buried head deep in it. #jesus #blood #atmosphere #authority #kingdom #darkness 

We have the upper hand in this war. When we realize this and begin walking in this authority, asking the Lord to reveal the hidden sins in the Light of His Presence and forgiving with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony, we gain more and more of the Authority that Jesus set aside for us as an inheritance. It isn’t fair that we can ask God for His Grace to cover us while we operate in new revelation. This might mean that the rights of the evil one get stepped on in the process. That is just the way it has to be. When we obey the Lord and bring His Will on earth as it is in Heaven, we have upper hand in all things. #light-of-jesus #hidden #forgiveness #authority #His-will 

Our God has the ultimate upper hand as the Creator of the universe, all-powerful, all-knowing, all-present. He is outside of time. Equally, His children have been given the same footing. When we realize just how deceived we’ve been, it can be mind boggling. The enemy uses every advantage it has against us. They operate in the spiritual world where most people cannot see. They lie. They distort God’s creation to make sin look and feel good to empower the temptation. The Truth is that we have authority to overcome all of their power. When this becomes real in our lives, the war becomes easy. #power #truth #authority #revelation #temptation 

With the Light of Jesus we see all plans of the enemy. We are able to overcome the darkness that evil hides in and know what to deal with in the right timing, and in the right sequence. We can see clearly to clean the bathtub. With the Blood of Jesus, we soak the grime on the bathtub and simultaneously kill all germs. The crusty junk detaches itself from the surface. Then with the Authority of Jesus, we easily wipe the bathtub clean. From start to finish, the advantage is ours!

### LEGAL MATTERS

An example of upper hand is when we spend time in the court room. No, I am not referring to the place you go after disrupting the peace at a Broncos game. The Throne Room of the Lord is like a court room in many ways. The plaintiff (accuser) brings charges daily against us (defendant). We must choose our attorney. Either we represent ourselves or we let Jesus defend us. Without Jesus we are found guilty and can succumb to condemnation and shame and get locked up in the dark. Or better, we plead the Blood of Jesus and are found Not Guilty. #jesus #guilt #blood-of-Jesus #forgiveness #cover 

But as with all court cases, there can be a “discovery phase” to the accusation. After all, before you can respond to an accusation, you have to know what exactly it is you are being accused of. So we demand full disclosure of the plaintiff. That is, the plaintiff must disclose all evidence that he is using against you in the accusation. All of this is taking place after the sin has been committed, so why, you ask would I care about having that information disclosed by the enemy? I don’t. It is right to demand the information that I am highlighting. #accuser #accusation 

There is no time in heaven. And we know that most all sin can include the temptation / urging of a demon. We therefore demand that the enemy disclose to us his plans, his strategies, his conspiracies, and in all ways that he is working towards bringing us down BEFORE we sin. Upper hand means that we have the advantage through the authority given to us from Jesus to require our enemy to tell us what he is planning so we can shut down the plans before they are given a chance to succeed. #sin #demon #temptation #authority #jesus 


### NO DISCERNMENT ZONE

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Hide me in the shadow of your wings.” [[Psalm 17_8b\|Psalm 17:8b]]* #bible-verse 

It always bothered me that demons have the ability to listen in on our conversations with our brothers and sisters, not to mention our prayers to the Lord. These are private and meant to be family business, not public. Because of this we now set up “No Discernment Zones” for the enemy camp. Through the authority given to us by the Lord, we exercise the principle of upper hand by commanding all demons to stop stealing information from us.

Demons only have the right to eavesdrop when we sin. When we are communicating in love and prayer, they have no right to listen in. We therefore command them to strip themselves of all “sensory” faculties (for lack of a better term) that they would normally use to gain intelligence. This is a war and we know that information is key. Cutting off this supply line is paramount to our strategy, both offensively and defensively. We therefore say that no agent of evil can see, hear, or in any way obtain information that can be used against us or the Kingdom of God. #prayer #relationship #secret-place #demons #sin #listen #kingdom #god #no-discernment-zone 

### INCUBATOR OF GRACE

> [!quote]+ 
>*“If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.” [[Luke 9_23b\|Luke 9:23b]]* #bible-verse 

Terraforming is not a formula. It is a lifestyle, a process of turning to God and receiving each day our daily bread of revelation, freedom, and healing. Although it is true to say that there are points of completion, especially with Terraforming places or things, most of the time the prayers are ongoing. A person will often times receive revelation of evil manifesting due to past sins for days, weeks, months, or even years after first asking the Lord to shine His Light on their lives. #terraforming #god #revelation #light #prayers #daily-bread 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.” [[Acts 15_11\|Acts 15:11]]* #bible-verse 

Yielding to our Father’s allotment of daily bread will often times result in periods of time between prayer when the job is only half done. This is a necessary part of the process and can result in a person being exposed to enemy exploitation. To combat this, we ask our Father for the blessing of His Grace to cover and protect them while we continue the process. We call this the “Incubator of Grace.” An incubator is a contained environment used to protect endangered babies while they grow and heal. Equally, we ask the Lord to provide this same kind of shelter. #wait #grace #rest 

The enemy can’t stand this kind of encroachment on their legal rights to torment and afflict. Under normal conditions, they would be able to punish the person through the sins that remain for the healing they received. We not only request this protection for the person, but we also command that the enemy cannot

bring retaliation or revenge. Unfortunately, we learned this lesson the hard way with many people leaving the prayer time with the target on their chest. But since we began praying this way, the opposite has been true with people getting to rest and seeing miraculous changes in their lives. The Lord has blessed us with such advantage because He loves His children so much! #daily-bread #father #prayer #grace #legal-right #rest #love 

### THIRD KEY

“Jesus has commissioned His royal priests to walk with the highest authority on earth, giving each son or daughter of God the full advantage in the war through their choice of Love.”

Creation was made by God to work in the favor of Love. Because of this, His children have the most potent weapon on earth: forgiveness with the Blood of Jesus. The advantage for not-Love is operating in the dark. When we walk as God designed us to in the Light the power of evil dissolves. This is not a level playing field.  #love #creation #light #forgiveness #blood #jesus

Before we can deliver we must understand who we are and what we are empowered to do. We are a people of love. As such we speak with love and humility in all of our dealings. Understanding and walking in the upper hand that we’ve been given is important to our task, but it is imperative that we do not extend this to become arrogant in our warfare. Yelling at demons, mocking them, or cursing them is not needed to defeat them. In many cases you are only harming the person being delivered, and yourself. Always pray as if the Lord Himself were in the room with you: with fear and humility. Because after all, He is in the room with you!  #love #demons #pray #alignment #god #identity #destiny 

### HOOKS AND LOOPS

> [!quote]+

Hook and loop fasteners (such as Velcro™) are known for their strength in holding two pieces of fabric together. The first layer contains multiple, tiny “hooks” while the second, fuzzy layer has “loops” that the hooks fasten onto. Once joined it is nearly impossible to take them apart with equal pressure across the fabric. You must peel them apart starting at either end.

Similarly, demons are looking for loops on us that they can sink their hooks into. If our surface is smooth, they are out of luck. If we have the hoops in place, they will stick and not let go. The “loops” in us come from sin. When we sin, we grant demons the legal right to fasten onto us with their “hooks.” The attachment is very powerful. The best way to undo this is to cause the “loops” to fall off of you. We do this when we forgive with the Blood of Jesus and then speak out the word of our testimony. Suddenly, there is no place for the hooks to grab ahold of! #demon #forgiveness #blood-of-Jesus #power #legal-right #freedom 

Demons are motivated. They obtain their legal rights to manifest from our sin, therefore, our sinning is the source of their power. As you can imagine, they have great incentive to get us to fall to their temptation and they are fierce when defending their strongholds. This is why they start with the “sweetness” of sin, i.e., self gratification from power, influence, heroic status, or the pleasure of sexuality. It is with these carrots that the enemy lures us into sin. Once we sin, they come back with accusation, condemnation, and shame. All are ways to trap us into the sin, build their stronghold, and receive unending power throughout generations of a family to manifest their evil on the earth. It is a terrible crime. #demons #sin #legal-right #forgiveness #blood #jesus #temptation #accusation #deception #generational-sins #demonic-stronghold

>*“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” [[Ephesians 6_12\|Ephesians 6:12]]* #bible-verse 

Once a single demon has locked onto us, more try to join that demon to create strength in numbers. The resulting strongholds can best be described as “electric onions.” There is a nucleus, which is a tiny demon, but has the most authority in the hierarchy. Each layer that covers the nucleus is a larger demon

(in size), but with less authority. Eventually you get huge demons that have little authority. The power of the stronghold comes from the sins that are the legal rights for each demon to be present. This is true of all of the demons, the little demons with great authority, and the huge demons with less authority. Together, they are a tough nut to crack.   #demons #authority #legal-right 

Each demon on the outer layers are named after their manifestation in the person. A demon named anger will manifest as anger. A demon named defiance will manifest as defiance in the person, and so on. There are a significant number of possibilities, but the best way to identify them is to watch the behavior of the person and the Holy Spirit will give you the name. If the person yells, “I am going to kill you!!!” It is likely that the demon’s name is murder. #demon #anger #holy-spirit #light-of-jesus #discernment 

The reason you need to know the name of the demon is simply in case the manifestation of the demon is causing a disturbance that prevents the person from having access to their own freewill. They need this access because they must choose to be free or the deliverance is temporary. Sometimes we need a stable environment in which to Terraform, and so we simply cast the demons away from the person and then head straight for the roots. #demons #legal-right #sin #holy-spirit #choice #terraforming #root #foundation #layers 

In the past we started with the outer layer of demons. This was problematic because those outer layer demons are bullies and will fight you tooth and nail. They are also compulsive liars and will muddy the water considerably. It is in the nature of a demon to hide, especially from a seasoned Terraformer. In most cases you will not know the demons are there (by manifestation) unless you pull a trigger that lets them know they are in trouble. Then things can get messy. #terraforming #demon #holy-spirit #discernment 

It is always preferable to neutralize the nucleus first. This is literally like unplugging any appliance, the power is gone and it is severely weakened. To take out the nucleus, you must pray and ask the Holy Spirit to lead you to the root sin, i.e., that which brought about the rights of the central demon to afflict the person. In most cases, these roots are generational (sins, curses, and memories). In other cases, the person was involved with witchcraft directly and repentance is needed.  In rare cases, the

root sin is due to the person not forgiving a trespasser. While this will cause affliction to a person, it is rarely found at the root of a demonic stronghold. #layers #demons #terraformer #holy-spirit #repenting #root #foundation #forgiveness #legal-right #generational-sins #generational-forgiveness 

### RENDERING DEMONS HOMELESS

> [!quote]+ 
>*“When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none. Then he says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first.” [[Matthew 12_43-45\|Matthew 12:43-45]]* #bible-verse 

The former house of an unclean spirit is the legal right that allows the demon to be there in the first place. Royal priests destroy these houses when they forgive with the Blood of Jesus and the word of their testimony. Because of this, the rights of the unclean spirits to return to the house from which they came are stripped, and the accuser is cast down. Simply stated, there is no longer a house for them to return to. They are now homeless. #legal-right #royal-priest #forgiveness #blood #jesus #accuser 

### WIPING THE BATHTUB CLEAN

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I have given you authority to...overcome all the power of the enemy.” [[Luke 10_19\|Luke 10:19]]* #bible-verse 

There is not always time to neutralize the nucleus first. Sometimes you will find a person in bad shape, manifesting demons right on the spot. When this happens, you need to shut down the manifestation so you can get to the roots. Dealing with the outer layers first is a long and painful process, so you are always better off getting the manifestation to stop and then working from the inside out. This will mean either casting out the demon or stripping them of their ability to interfere with God’s work while you are praying. #root #demon #layer #prayer #authority 

When casting out a demon, the first rule of thumb is to stay calm. Demons are trying to control the environment, which they can only do if you let them or agree that they are dominant. Your decision to not allow them to manipulate your emotions (specifically fear) will establish this at the forefront.  The more

---
<p style="text-align:center;">
- 72 -

</p> 
{ #p72}


---

we Terraform, the more authority we receive from God, and the more confidence we have that our prayers will affect the person’s condition. #prayer #authority #god #confidence #rest #trust 

Remember that demons manifest by name or purpose. They are easy to spot by the words spoken by the person. If the person is angry, the demon is anger. If the person is afraid, the demon is fear. If the person becomes frenzied, the demon could be insanity or frenzy. The point is that you now know what you are dealing with. To shut down or cast out a demon before you’ve obtained the rights to permanently remove them, pray this:  #anger #freedom #authority #demons #discernment #terraforming 

*“Father, I ask You for grace. Lord You love Jim so much and want him to be healed. I ask You to give us the safe environment to get him set free. Even though the rights are not yet stripped, I ask you to enforce our words with power.” *Then say this for each demon that manifests, *“Demon of fear, I bind you, muzzle you, and strip you of all rights to manifest while we are praying.”* #sample-prayer 

The next step is to ask the Lord to reveal the roots, the hidden sins in the Light of His Presence ([[Psalm 90_8\|Ps. 90:8]]). The hidden sins are those that have given these demons the right to manifest in the person’s life. Once you find the sin, all that is needed is to fully forgive the sinner and cast down the accuser. The short version sounds like this:  #bible-verse #root #legal-right 

*“We forgive Jim’s father of witchcraft. We wash his feet with the Blood of Jesus that the power of his sins are broken. All witchcraft is dismantled, unraveled, and undone, rendered powerless to harm Jim. They are purified of this unrighteousness, redeemed of every consequence, and restored to the men of God they were created to be. We cast down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.”* #sample-prayer

The demon of fear that you previously bound and held until the root was discovered has just lost all rights to torment and afflict Jim. You are now ready to permanently remove the demon from Jim’s life. From our bathtub analogy, we have turned on the Light, soaked the grime with disinfectant (Blood), and are now ready to wipe the detached grime off of the bath tub (Authority). #root #revelation #sin #light-of-jesus  #forgiveness #blood-of-Jesus  #purified #demon #fear  #authority

The root of the fear has been discovered and destroyed through the manifestation of love in the forgiveness of Jim’s father.

The most common question we hear is, “OK, but where are we supposed to cast these demons? Out into mid air? Doesn’t that just leave the demon available to torment someone else?” There are many suggestions I’ve heard for the answer to this question, anywhere from “yes, mid air is fine” to “the outer darkness.” For those new to this authority, I believe the best answer is “to the Feet of Jesus ([[Romans 16_20\|Rom. 16:20]]).” The reason for this is that we know that Jesus is the Judge, and He will determine what happens to them after that. #bible-verse 

That being said, I am convinced that the Lord is in the process granting us the authority to cast demons into the abyss for torment, both permanently and temporary. Some may argue that this is not what Jesus did, specifically in [[Luke 8_31\|Luke 8:31]] when the demons begged Him not to order them into the abyss and He chose not to. But I believe that Jesus demonstrated to us that this decision is one made by a mature son or daughter of God, is not done in every instance, and requires relationship between us and our Lord to know when to and when not to. Without question, the right to cast into the abyss surfaces when the demon is trying to meddle with the DNA of a human through the combination of witchcraft and incest ([[2 Peter 2_4\|2 Pet. 2:4]]). But until you have this authority through experience and relationship, I advise casting to the feet of Jesus. #bible-verse #authority #jesus #sons-and-daughters #relationship #maturity 

### FLUSH THE BUSHES

Demons do not always manifest at first. Sometimes you need them to in order to identify who they are and what they are doing there. We call this “flushing the bushes.” Just like in hunting when you get the birds out of the bushes (hiding) and into the air (visible and easy to shoot), we do the same. This can be accomplished through various methods including worshiping, forgiving, or commanding them out.

My favorite is to ask the Lord to pour His All Consuming Fire into the person to roast out anything impure. *“He will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver.” [[Malachi 3_3a\|Mal. 3:3a]] *The heat of His Fire forces all impurities to the surface to be revealed

### DIGITAL AUDIO RECORDINGS

Let’s say you put on a digital audio recording of your favorite artist singing to the Lord. The sound quality is excellent. You are truly listening to that person sing this song. But is that artist actually in the room singing to you? No, of course not! What you have is a perfect recording of their voice that can be played over and over again, but not actually them doing the singing.

So too, demons operate with humans. They bring powerful temptations to the soul (mind, will, emotions) of a person to sin for generations. When you come along and remove that demon, the power source of the sin, the soul continues to “play recordings” of that demon because it has learned to do so. Not realizing this can be a source of great frustration when delivering a person of a demonic influence. People can sometimes mimic the demon after you’ve removed it. It might not seem like it, but the demon is gone. #generational-sins #demon 

The mind especially needs to be healed of this trauma. There are many ways that the evil one brings destruction and disfunction to the mind after years of abuse. We pray for the soul to be healed just like we do a broken arm, deafness, or cancer. We ask the Lord to heal that body part instantaneously, or through process, in accordance with His Will. Equally, we ask Him to heal that part of the soul. This part of deliverance takes the longest. You can cast out a demon in minutes, but the healing of the soul takes however long God says. He knows best. In His timing and sequence, a person is healed safely and permanently. Both are fundamental objectives of deliverance. #generational-sins #temptation #sin #soul #demon #trauma #god #His-will #healing #heart-of-God #deliverance #evil-one

## Chapter 10: Adulthood

Some people may ask, “why are we able to hurl down the accuser now and not for the last 2,000 years?” The answer is that something amazing has happened in the church. All creation has been groaning for this day when the sons (adult sons) of God are revealed ([[Romans 8_19\|Rom. 8:19]]). The Spirit of the Lord is testifying that in this day God has given five talents ([[Matthew 25_14-30\|Matt. 25:14-30]]) to His sons all across the world and they have said “yes” to their calling. They have accepted the invitation. They are fulfilling all that God expects of them. They have laid all that they have on the altar. They have sold all of their possessions to follow Jesus ([[Matthew 19_21\|Matt. 19:21]]). They do not love their lives so much as to shrink from death. #bible-verse #sons-and-daughters #maturity #relationship #invitation 

The Church has grown into a corporate adulthood. Although, as individuals, we may be at different “spiritual ages” (newborns in Christ, toddlers, adolescents, adults), the Church itself has attained a corporate maturity ([[Ephesians 4_13\|Eph. 4:13]]) that has been long misunderstood. The sign of the maturing is the release of authority that God has given us because we are adults, and therefore are trustworthy to handle it.  The trigger was when

<p style="text-align:center;">

those sons and daughters were revealed through their answer of “yes” to the call, and through their heart of giving all to God. #adult-season #maturity  #bible-verse  #sons-and-daughters  #authority #god #heart #spirit-of-God  #invitation    #relationship 

The fruit of this Church age will be seeing the saints attain fullness in Christ. But before this can happen, we have some catching up to do. The adolescent sons and daughters of God must embrace the discipline of our Father. This process of maturing where the sanctification by the Spirit of God is made manifest can be painful. Because of this, many men and women of God shirk from the rod of the Lord. It is impossible to avoid His discipline, but the key is for us to embrace it. That is, to receive the Lord’s discipline as a freewill choice of our soul. By doing so, we obtain all that He intends for us without rebellion which hardens our hearts. #soul #maturing #seasons #spirit-of-God #choice #father #sons-and-daughters 

### TWO HOUSES

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever.” [[2 Samuel 7_16\|2 Samuel 7:16]]* #bible-verse

The Lord really likes David. He is a man after His own heart. While it is true that David made mistakes, he never betrayed the Lord. He had an intimate relationship with God that grew deeper and deeper as his life went on. David displayed the love and mercy of God everywhere he went. He was a fierce warrior, but tender as a lamb. Because of his heart, the Lord made David’s house permanent. Jesus was a direct descendent of David; the Kingdom of God comes from his loins.#heart-of-God #relationship #jesus #David #love #heart #intimacy 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“You acted foolishly," Samuel said. "You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD's command.”* [[1 Samuel 13_13-14\|1 Samuel 13:13-14]]*  #bible-verse 

Saul did not have an intimate relationship with the Lord. Samuel did. As such, when Saul needed to know whether Israel should turn left or right, he had to ask Samuel. The house of Saul was plagued with failure. It was never God’s intent for His government to be lead through the will of man. The Lord wants

us to be intimate with Him so we can operate out of His Will. Once Saul was anointed, he continuously disobeyed the Lord, was jealous, angry, fearful, and had a heart for murder. When pinned, he resorted to witchcraft to get what he wanted. He was God’s anointed, but he relied on his own strength instead of seeking the Will of the Father. #surrogate #relationship #intimacy #His-will #strength #anger #fear #choice 

God is calling His people to make a choice. Will we align ourselves with the house of Saul or the house of David? The answer is so obvious to the modern Christian that it makes the question seem rhetorical. Of course we all choose the house of David! Everything that we believe in rests in the Lord Jesus Christ who Himself is of the house of David. Would we choose different from our Lord? But if we are ready for the fruit of this choice (kingdom endures forever), are we ready for the cost (crucifixion)? #choice #david #kingdom #jesus

In the original covenants (old testament), tithing was a first fruit offering to God of 10%. In the fulfilling covenant (new testament), Jesus wants everything. That is, 100% of us belongs to God. By giving Him everything that we are in full submission, we are preparing ourselves for our wedding. This intimate relationship of dependency for protection, sustenance, health, and understanding is critical to our developing into the fullness of our calling. Knowing that all Hebrew covenants among family cannot be ended, it is important to add that the Lord still honors His call for a tithe, which is why many people can attest to its benefits. But the fullness of God is realized when we give Him everything we have.  #choice #kingdom #covenant #relationship #intimacy #wedding #bride #bride-covenant #trust

When we choose the house of David, we must embrace the unending covenants that the Lord made with him. The section of David’s covenant ([[2 Samuel 7_12-16\|2 Sam. 7:12-16]]) that most prefer to overlook is the one where the Lord says that He will discipline us with the same wooden instrument used by parents on their children. That He will bring humans into our lives to administer His discipline. This goes against everything that our current Western culture accepts. #bible-verse #David #covenant 

The idea of God disciplining His children that are adults in body so that they can become adults in spirit is “outside of the box” if you’ve made the mistake of trying to put God in a box. Some are too prideful to submit to such instruction. Others have been wounded by the spirit of religion whereby humans of the house of Saul controlled them through manipulation and fear, and then called it discipline. This is not what is described in scripture.

The Lord has outlined a process by which all persons in the house of David will fully submit themselves to God’s discipline no matter what it looks like. They trust that through their intimate relationship with the Lord, He will bless and protect them. This is a requirement for entering into the fullness of our calling. It is the bridge scripture between the birth of David’s offspring (verse 12) and their responsibilities as kings (verse 16). That is, before we can get to adulthood, we must embrace the discipline of the Lord (verse 14). #covenant  #spirit #religion #trust #intimacy #relationship #sons-and-daughters #love  

### ADULTHOOD DESCRIBED

When I was a kid, I despised school. I did not want to get up early, I wanted to sleep in. I did not want to take the time to shower and get dressed, I wanted to lounge in my pajamas. I did not want to study and learn, I wanted to play and have fun. I did not want to learn social skills by interacting with people I did not like. My grades were poor, I had a “C” average by the time I graduated High School. Then as an adult, I went back to school and earned a masters degree from a very good school. My grades were excellent; I had an “A” average even though I was going to school full-time while working full-time. What made the difference? As an adult, I loved learning, I embraced learning, and so therefore, I learned.  I understood that the

benefit of having learned was far greater than the cost of learning.

When I was a kid, time moved so slowly. A school year felt like a school DECADE. Growing up from the age of 6 to the age of 16 (driver’s license) seemed to take forever. Learning to play guitar chords starting at age 10 was a long and painful process. Then as an adult, the years seem to fly by! What made the difference? There is an acceleration that occurs when we are adults due to the maturity of our minds. I can learn to do new things very quickly. Time is the same, but I have changed dramatically. #change #transition #adult-season

When I was a kid, I strongly disliked mushrooms. I wasn’t all that excited about vegetables either. Broccoli and spinach were never on the menu and you did not even think about feeding me lima beans. I would not have eaten sushi if you had paid me a thousand dollars. Then as an adult, everything changed. Sushi is my favorite food, I love vegetables, and only eat mushroom pizza. What made the difference? As an adult my taste buds have changed. My pallet desires more than just sweet and salty. I want flavors and the more the merrier.  #seasons #change #adult-season #maturity #transition 

### ADULTHOOD OF THE CHURCH

When I started High School, it was rough being a Freshman. I was new to the freedoms that come with the promotion from Junior High to High School, and the greater expectations that were placed on my shoulders. As a freshman, I had little to no authority in the hallways walking between classes. Upperclassmen clarified their superiority with verbal and non- verbal communication, and often with intangible and __tangible__ demonstrations. Then one day, I was a senior! I was top dog. No one bossed me around and all fear was gone. I was content and happy. I then graduated from High School and went to college. Suddenly I found myself a freshman again...

The entire body of Christ has just been promoted from seniors in the adolescent age of the church to freshmen in the adult age of the church. We are enlisted sergeants who have been field promoted to second lieutenants. We are all adapting to a significant change in our environment that brings disorientation and in some cases, a temporary loss of balance. Things that used to work great are now not working at all or with less effect. The Lord is revealing new things to us that are working better than we’ve ever seen before, all evidence of a corporate promotion. #transition #mature #seasons 

This reality can be very difficult for some people to come to terms with. In some cases there are those who attained positions of great authority in the adolescent age of the church (seniors), who now find their authority for moving the Church forward has radically reduced or even been removed. None of us were promoted to seniors, but some are destined to, and those will step up to the plate in the very near future.  #transition #seasons #authority #trust #journeying  #maturity 

Adult sons and daughters of the King have been sent by Jesus to do everything He was sent to do by the Father. Jesus was the prototype who replicated Himself through His multi-audience teachings. He taught to the infants in Christ, the toddlers, the pre-schoolers, middle childhoods, the pre-pubescent, adolescents, and the adults. But it was to the adult children that He taught to replace Him once He was gone. As individuals, this is an important part of understanding how our gifts will work to their full potential. But corporately, this means that the Church must get ready to be Christ on earth. We are to do everything that He did. By Himself, Jesus fulfilled [[Isaiah 61_1-2a\|Isa. 61:1-2a]]. The adult Church of Jesus Christ will finish this corporately: #sons-and-daughters #change #seasons #gifts

## Chapter 11: The Commission
 #chapter #His-will #authority 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“‘As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.’” [[John 20_21b\|John 20:21b]]* #bible-verse 

So, how did the Father send Jesus? For us to realize our calling as adult sons and daughters of God, we must advance our mindsets past that of the servant. Servants have no authority beyond what they’ve been told to do by their masters. When walking out these instructions, the servant is like a police officer, carrying the badge of his master’s authority. Outside of this, a servant has no authority of his own. Additionally, we must go well past the mindset of a friend. Friends have credibility when speaking on behalf of a person, but no real authority. As family, however, we embody the authority of our Father. What we say, He says. What we do, He does. #sons-and-daughters #servant-covenant #relationship #authority #jesus

Before Jesus could walk in His ministry, He had to grow up. Most theologians believe that Jesus was around 30 years old when His ministry began. Jesus was an adult. He was born from Mary’s womb and learned to walk, talk, and operate as a human being. He was taught to read, to write, and how to live as a citizen of the world He was born into. It is so important to recognize that He was not released into His ministry until He reached adulthood. Only then was He mature enough to handle the responsibilities of His Father’s authority. #friendship-covenant  #authority #maturity #adult-season 

Finally, before the spirit-filled Son of God was released in His ministry, He was tested. Our Father desires to reveal the hidden sins ([[Daniel 2_22\|Dan. 2:22]] / [[Psalm 90_8\|Ps. 90:8]]) that would cause us to fail in the

<p style="text-align:center;">

tasks assigned to us. No sin was found in Jesus. Once released, Jesus connected with those His Father revealed to Him as being His disciples. He then began to teach them through the demonstration of the Kingdom of God, followed by careful explanations of why He did what He did. Through this He simultaneously loved the world, while replicating Himself through instruction to His disciples. He knew that they would replace Him after He was gone. #bible-verse #preparation #jesus #transition  

When Jesus delegated authority to them, we see Him having the right to do this because He was the Son of God. The transition in mindset that we must adopt comes when we realize that WE are to have disciples ([[Matthew 28_19-20\|Matt. 28:19-20]]), demonstrate and explain the Kingdom, and then delegate authority to them as well. In every way that the Father sent Jesus, Jesus has sent us. This is our commission. It is what we are called to do. #bible-verse #jesus #sin #kingdom #authority #transition #father 


### THREE TYPES OF AUTHORITY

> [!quote]+ 
>*“These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons.” [[Matthew 10_5a,8a\| Matthew 10:5a,8a]]* #bible-verse 
>
>*“The seventy-two returned with joy and said, ‘Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.’” [[Luke 10_17\|Luke 10:17]]* #bible-verse 

There are three (3) types of authority released by the Father through the ministry of His Son, Jesus Christ. The first is the name of Jesus (Hebrew “*Yeshua*”). Commissioned with this authority before Jesus was crucified, the twelve disciples were able to bring a dramatic change in the condition of those they prayed for. People were healed, resurrected, cleansed, and delivered. Today, many Christians attribute these powers with being baptized with the Holy Spirit. In the gospels, however, it was only the commission from Jesus and His Name that empowered His followers to operate with God’s supernatural power. #yeshua #hebrew/word/yeshua #authority #father #jesus #miracles #holy-spirit 

> [!quote]+ 
>*‘Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.’” [[John 20_22b-23\|John 20:22b-23]]* #bible-verse

The second authority also comes from the commission of Jesus, but requires that we receive the Holy Spirit. After His resurrection, Jesus extended this to His followers who had been promoted to Apostles. He does this today for those who believe in Him ([[Ephesians 1_13-14\|Eph. 1:13-14]]). We have this authority as royal priests ([[Tapestry/Bible/1 Peter/1 Peter 2_9\|1 Pet. 2:9]]) who have been called to prepare the way of the Lord. The fruit of this authority is setting the captives free and hurling down the accuser through the forgiveness of sins with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. #bible-verse #holy-spirit #resurrection #royal-priest #rescue #authority #accuser #forgiveness #blood #jesus #testimony 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues [*languages*] as the Spirit enabled them.” [[Acts 2_3-4\|Acts 2:3-4]]* #bible-verse 


The third and final authority released by the Father through the ministry of Jesus was when He anointed them with Fire through the Holy Spirit. This was prophesied by John the Baptist ([[Matthew 3_11\|Matt. 3:11]]) and was a part of the instructions Jesus gave them when He told them to wait before leaving Jerusalem ([[Acts 1_4-5\|Acts 1:4-5]]). Those given this authority will be refined by the Fire of God ([[Zechariah 13_9\|Zech. 13:9]]). The fruit of this authority is to draw His people together in unity ([[John 17_21\|John 17:21]] / [[Acts 2_5-11\|Acts 2:5-11]]), to shorten timeframes required for work to be completed ([[Acts 8_39-40\|Acts 8:39-40]]), and to magnify the impact of Kingdom work to greater areas of influence. #bible-verse   #holy-spirit #authority #unity #connection 

This anointing is equivalent to the position held by Moses. The Lord anointed and sent him to lead the Israelites. Those in the book of Acts were anointed to birth the church of Jesus Christ and see the gospel spread across the world. It is interesting to note that when Korah and certain Reubenites rebelled against Moses’ authority, the Lord destroyed them, their families, and all of their possessions (Numbers 16). This was different than Peter and John’s refusal to obey the commands of the Sanhedrin ([[Acts 4_19\|Acts 4:19]]), who were leaders that God did not anoint. #bible-verse #authority #jesus #kingdom #journey #father  

### WILL OF GOD

>*did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from Me, you evildoers!'” [[Matthew 7_21-23\|Matthew 7:21-23]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus was adamant about the importance of the Will of His Father when teaching His Disciples about The Way. He would only do what He saw the Father doing ([[John 5_19\|John 5:19]]) while equally noting how the power of His Name is of no eternal value if spoken outside of His Father’s Will ([[Matthew 7_21-23\|Matt. 7:21-23]]). When we are sent under Jesus’ commission, we not only produce the same output He produced, but we are fed from the same input as well. The output will be miracles, signs and wonders, healing, deliverance, resurrections, forgiveness of sins, hurling down the accuser, and setting the captives free. The input will be the Father’s Will. Before we do all of those things, we listen to the still small voice within us that leads us to His Will. We learn to get the “green light” from God before moving in His power. #bible-verse #miracles #His-will 

The Will of God is not only the “desire” of the Lord, i.e., what He wants, but what will be. Our Father created this universe knowing the outcome of every variable (including all behaviors) by every particle in it across all time through which the universe will exist. The universe literally surrounds His objective of Love. Through His sovereignty as creator, the Will of the Father is not a hope, but a reality in Heaven. Our job is to establish it on earth. #His-will #father  #healing #deliverance #resurrection #forgiveness #love #sin #accuser #heaven 

### WORD OF GOD

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For nothing is impossible with God *[and His word]*.”*[[Luke 1_37\|Luke 1:37]]* #bible-verse 
>
>*“So is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.” [[Isaiah 55_11\|Isaiah 55:11]]* #bible-verse 

When the Will of God is spoken (uttered) on earth, it literally becomes the Word of God (greek “*rhema*”). For us to do this, we need to be filled with the Holy Spirit, that these words are expressed to our spirits and released from our mouths. Once God speaks His Will to us and we speak it on earth, it will stand

forever. It is powerful and complete. It will accomplish what He intended for it. These words can be spoken at any point in time as a current reality even if it has not manifested in our time yet. Jesus did this several times. #greek #rhema #His-will #holy-spirit 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“...because the prince of this world now stands condemned.” [[John 16_11\|John 16:11]]* #bible-verse 
>
>*“I have overcome the world.” [[John 16_33c\|John 16:33c]]* #bible-verse 

In both of these testimonies, Jesus is quoted as speaking of things yet to come as if they have already happened. These “past-tense prophesies” are easy to miss if you are not looking for them. They can also be hard to grasp as intended, but once you do, they change your life. Jesus was able to speak of His success on the cross three chapters before it happens! This is the Word of God. Later in his letters, Paul identifies this prince as being “*now at work in those who are disobedient*” ([[Ephesians 2_2\|Eph. 2:2]]), yet Jesus describes him as being condemned years earlier. So which of them is correct? They both are. Paul was speaking within the context of the time of his writing, Jesus was speaking out the Word of God which is timeless. #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages He might show the incomparable riches of His grace, expressed in His kindness to us in Christ Jesus.” [[Ephesians 2_6-7\|Ephesians 2:6-7]]* #bible-verse 

We consist of a body, soul, and spirit. Our spirits are seated in the heavenly realms right now. In this realm, a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years is like a day ([[Psalm 90_4\|Ps. 90:4]]). So for us, part of our being is confined within time (body, soul) while the rest of us is not confined within time (spirit). It is because of this that we are able to recognize what is true in the timeless realm of heaven on earth which is confined by time. Some of the things that we proclaim on earth may not be a reality at that particular point in time, but can be professed nonetheless. #bible-verse 

The kingdom of darkness will lose the war against the Kingdom of God. Jesus knew this because through the Holy Spirit, He is outside of time.  His Will is for Love to prevail, so it is true in

the timelessness of God. Therefore the defeat of satan (condemned) can be spoken of now as the Word of God even though this defeat has not happened yet in our time. Once the body of Christ realizes this truth, we will start fighting the war from the standpoint of a victory that will happen, but has not yet. We therefore must fight with all diligence, recognizing that if we don’t, the enemy will continue to win battles (cancer, suicide, murder, etc) that we should be winning. Our calling is to fulfill the past-tense prophesies spoken by Jesus as the Word of God. In summary, the world will be overcome by the Kingdom of God. #His-will #kingdom #love 

In the last couple of years, the Lord has been teaching the body of Christ about apostolic proclamations. With these we have seen prophets give words of knowledge to the apostles who then declare these on earth, seeding the atmosphere with life and sending angels on important acts of duty. This was a catch-up process given to us by the Lord to put into place the basic teaching on proclamations that was missing from the Church. It foreshadowed what was to come, which is the kingly act of hearing God’s Will in heaven and speaking It out as the Word of God on earth. Only adult sons and daughters of the King have the authority to do this. #sons-and-daughters #authority #adult-season 

Every human being alive on earth today is invited to believe in Jesus, receive the Holy Spirit which is our deposit, and to follow the leading of the Lord to the Will of the Father. When we do this the Lord will release more and more of our irrevocable gifts so we can make those unique irreplaceable contributions to the fulfillment of the Word of God in our time as it is in heaven. Not just on earth from a geographical standpoint, but from the standpoint of time (fulfilled now). As we walk in the fullness of the authority we have been delegated (Miracles from His Name, forgiveness from the Holy Spirit, and power from the anointing), we will complete the path of our destiny, our calling, and that for which Christ Jesus took hold of us. #His-will #authority #holy-spirit

## Chapter 12: Healing a Person

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.” [[Matthew 10_8\|Matthew 10:8]]* #bible-verse 

The Father sent Jesus with the power and authority to heal the sick. Now Jesus has sent us to do the same. Throughout the last 100 years, this understanding has been restored to the Church and most believers agree that healing is within the Will of God. The question that arises is why are some healed while others are not. Is it the Will of God for everyone to be healed? We know that by His wounds that trickled with Blood (*greek : molops*), we are healed ([[1 Peter 2_24\|1 Pet. 2:24]]). So why do people still suffer from cancer? #bible-verse #greek #molops #His-will

>*“Some men brought to Him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, ‘Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.’ At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, ‘This fellow is blaspheming!’”* [[Matthew 9_2-3\|Matthew 9:2-3]]* #bible-verse 

Jesus demonstrated two basic types of healing while He was on earth. The first was based upon forgiveness. We call this a “**Matthew 9**” type healing. When Jesus came to the paralytic, He saw that they had faith and then declared that the sins of the man were forgiven. This was quite a bold statement made by the man from Nazareth. The Jewish pharisees of the time were in shock, and although they said nothing, Jesus knew their thoughts. Jesus’ response that “*the Son of Man has authority on*

*earth to forgive sins*” was equally as brazen. Let’s break down this type of healing into smaller parts for better understanding. #His-will #blood #jesus #healed #healing #forgiveness 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.” [[Matthew 8_10\|Matthew 8:10]]* #bible-verse 

First, Jesus saw that they had faith. Almost every specific healing mentioned in the gospels references the presence of, or lack of faith in the people. There are two sides to faith, the first is __belief__ that comes from divine revelation. Jesus saw this kind of faith in the centurion. The man was a Gentile (hence Jesus’ reference to people coming from the east and west) and knew little about the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Yet he knew the power of Jesus with divine insight. The Canaanite woman from Tyre and Sidon ([[Matthew 15_21-28\|Matt. 15:21-28]]) had the same faith. She believed through divine revelation, Jesus recognized it, and her daughter was delivered. #bible-verse #faith #power #jesus 

The next side of faith is a __lack of deception__. In Matthew 9, Jesus saw that the paralytic had received revelation from the Lord as to the specific sin that caused him to be paralyzed and that he had a repentant heart. Many of us have sin in our lives that comes from our choices or the choices of our forefathers. The enemy does not want us to know about these and will deceive us to keep us from dealing with them. Either we have agreed with the enemy and hardened our hearts towards repentance, or we don’t know about them because they were the sins of our parents, grandparents, or great grandparents. Once Jesus saw this kind of faith, all that was left was for Him to forgive! #faith #revelation #heart #generational-sins #forgiveness 

Thirdly, Jesus did not say that the Son of God had authority on earth to forgive sins, but the Son of Man. Filled with the Holy Spirit, Jesus was authorized to bring forgiveness to the paralytic. Some may ask, if there is no forgiveness without the shedding of Blood, how did Jesus do this? The Holy Spirit within Jesus is outside of time. Jesus was bringing the Will of the Father to earth as it is in heaven when He forgave this man before His Blood was shed! Hurling down the accuser is the function of the adult age of His Church, so Jesus saved this for when John’s book of *“what must soon take place” *([[Revelation 1_1\|Rev. 1:1]]) was to be fulfilled. #bible-verse #son-of-man #His-will #blood-of-Jesus

We have seen many Matthew 9 healing examples over the last few years. Earlier in 2009 we were at a conference where we met a woman who requested prayer for cancer. We put together a team and took her into a private room for prayer. When we started, the Lord gave me a sensation in my right lymph node. I asked her what this might mean and she said, “the doctors believe that this cancer has moved into my lymph nodes, and if so, it is terminable.” 

We continued to pray and the Lord gave me a vision of a male in her family with a freemason apron on speaking idolatrous oaths and vows. As he spoke them his throat was being permeated with a black ooze. It was defiling him and causing disease in his throat. I asked her if she knew of any freemasons in her family, and she said, “Yes, my grandfather was a freemason. He has since passed away.”   #holy-spirit #forgiveness #blood #His-will  #generational-sins #freemasons 
 
I led her through forgiving her grandfather by sprinkling him with the Blood of Jesus. She spoke out the testimony that all curses were broken and that the defilement of idolatry was washed away. We were clear that all witchcraft was dismantled, unraveled, undone, and rendered powerless. We hurled down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of his testimony. As we prayed this she began to glow. Literally. It was as if Light was radiating out of her. #blood-of-Jesus #forgiveness #washed #witchcraft #dismantle 

When we stopped praying she began to make a fist out of her left hand and stare at it with shock. Not understanding, I asked if everything was OK. She said that she had arthritis and that she had not been able to make a fist for ten years! God had healed the arthritis in her left hand while she was declaring the forgiveness of her grandfather. Later that week she went to the doctor for a test. When the results came back, there was a problem. They could find no trace of cancer in her body! This is a Matthew 9 healing. The root sin was revealed in the Light of His Presence. With the authority of the Holy Spirit within us, the sinner was forgiven and the sin washed away. All rights of the evil one to torment her with cancer were stripped. She was healed completely. #forgiveness #healing #healed #root #sin #light #testimony #prayer

The second type of healing has nothing to do with forgiveness. We call this a **John 9 **type healing. This type is a supernatural miracle that occurs so the work of God will be displayed in a person’s life. The disciples asked Jesus whose sin caused the illness not because of their mistaken theology, but because that was why everyone else they had seen healed was sick in the first place!

Most healing examples that we see today, however, are Matthew 9 types. It is imperative that the Church understand this to avoid accusing God of not loving, rejecting, or abandoning them. This is not the case! The problem is that we have 100 years of recent history where highly anointed people healed by asking the Lord for an instantaneous, supernatural healing (John 9). These healing examples are very dramatic and send a clear message that God is in the healing business. #healing #forgiveness #rejection #abandoning #favorites #supernatural 

The Azuza Street Revival and its offspring brought healing back into the limelight at the turn of the twentieth century. In the 1940’s, ministers such as Oral Roberts, William Branham, and Kathryn Kuhlman saw the anointing for healing explode. But as these ministries began to track their own fruit, it became apparent that a small number of the people that they prayed for were healed by praying this way. Most figures indicate that one to five percent of people are healed instantaneously through what we call a John 9 healing. #revival #revelation #healed #prayer

That does not demean what was accomplished. God wanted to reintroduce His supernatural power back into the Church and did so with great impact. It is important that we make room for God to heal instantaneously every time we pray for someone! He is God and He heals this way today! In the same month that we prayed for the woman who was healed of arthritis and cancer, we attended a separate conference. At the end we asked everyone who wanted to be healed to come for prayer. There were three of us praying, and 21 people who wanted prayer, so we each took seven people. #healing #prayer #supernatural

The first person I prayed for was standing on my right side. She told me that her knee had been injured 20 years ago. She had endured seven surgeries to date with no success and was still in pain. I started to pray and all of a sudden I saw my left hand catch on Fire in the spirit. This gift of seeing is new, so I was very surprised! The vision only lasted for a second, but the heat of the fire continued for some time. Not knowing what else to do, I threw my left hand on her knee and asked the Lord to heal her. #healing #prayer 

The person on my left side had a varicose vein that was so painful, she could not sleep at night. I asked a female next to her to lay hands on the vein, and then I put my left hand (still on fire) on her hand. I asked the Lord to heal the vein and the pain instantaneously stopped! Praise God!!! At this very moment, the lady on my right with the painful knee grabbed me by the shirt and yelled, “THANK YOU!!!” and ran off. I then prayed for three ladies for various needs including issues with grandchildren, husbands, and employment. #prayer #gift #vision #spirit #testimony 

Later I spoke to the lady with the painful knee. She told me that when I prayed the pain left her leg for the first time in 20 years! When it happened, she was so in shock that she could not say anything to me. The shock wore off and she was jumping up and down all around the room, laughing, crying, and thanking the Lord! We praised His Name for the rest of the night, celebrating the goodness of God. Every person prayed for that day was healed. #healing  #testimony 

Both the lady with the painful knee, and the lady with the varicose vein were healed according to what is written in John 9. No one was forgiven, they simply believed that God could heal them and they were. God anointed me with a hand of Fire to lay on their wounds and we saw the work of God displayed in their lives. While we have seen many of these types of healing examples, most of the people that we’ve seen healed over the last two to three years have been through the forgiveness of sins, hurling down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. #testimony #faith #healing #forgiveness #blood-of-Jesus

### KINSMAN-REDEEMERS

> [!quote]+ 
>*"The LORD bless him!" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. "He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead." She added, "That man is our close relative; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers. [[Ruth 2_20\|Ruth 2:20]]* #bible-verse

With the release of the authority to hurl down the accuser, the Church has been given a great gift from God. For thousands of years the human race has been paying the price for the sins of our forefathers. Modern scientists recognized this as hereditary or genetic illness (mental or physical) that is passed through the DNA from parent to child. In the Kingdom of God, we know that these are the result of sins that are punishable for three to four generations. #authority #accuser #generational-sins #kingdom #gift 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“'The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.'” [[Numbers 14_18\|Numbers 14:18]]* #bible-verse

Generational sins, iniquities, and memories are passed down to children from their forefathers. The impact to these children can be devastating in the form of behavioral sins, physical illness, mental illness, and demonic oppression. The worst of these come from sins of defilement which include bloodshed, broken covenant, idolatry (witchcraft has the worst impact), and sexual immorality (incest has the worst impact). The children grow up and find themselves struggling with issues such as anger, fear, torment, lust, depression, and a laundry list of ailments. #generational-sins #defilement #broken-covenant #witchcraft #anger #fear #lust 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.”* [[1 Peter 1_18-19\|1 Peter 1:18-19]]* #bible-verse

The Blood of Jesus brings redemption to the world to strip evil of its rights to manifest from these sins. When we forgive our forefathers by sprinkling them with the Blood of Jesus, they are purified and they are redeemed. So then are their children.  #covenant #redemption #blood #jesus #purified

When we speak out the word of this testimony, the accuser is hurled down and the legal rights are stripped.

> [!quote]+ 
>*“No Ammonite or Moabite or any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD, even down to the tenth generation.” [[Deuteronomy 23_3\|Deuteronomy 23:3]]* #bible-verse 

As with all Terraforming, the prayer is led by the Holy Spirit. We ask Him which generation of forefathers to start with and then go down from there to the person we are praying for. Under extreme cases we have started at the 20th generation, and found sins that gave rights to demons to afflict them. In a few cases we have prayed, “all the way back to Adam.” But with most cases, the Lord leads us to start at the fourth (4th) generation. The prayer essentially looks like this:  #terraforming #legal-right #holy-spirit #generational-sins #demons

*“Father I forgive my great-grandparents. I sprinkle them with the Blood of Jesus that the power of their sins are broken.”* #sample-prayer 

If there is no highlight from the Holy Spirit (physical, spiritual, or mental alarms going off), you can move on to the next generation. When a highlight occurs, continue with this prayer:

*“All sins of defilement: bloodshed, broken covenant, idolatry, and sexual immorality are washed away. Are curses are broken. All covenants of evil are dissolved. All witchcraft is dismantled, unraveled, and undone. It is rendered powerless to harm us. We are purified of all unrighteousness, redeemed of all consequences, and restored to the men and women of God that we were created to be. I ask you, Father to remember our sins no more. I hurl down the accuser against my family with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony.”* #sample-prayer 

Continue on to each generation. Note that the third (3rd) generation is their grandparents, and the second (2nd) generation are their parents. All first generation forgiveness is repentance of personal sins, or forgiveness of a sibling. These sins do not meet the definition of “generational sins” and therefore the first generation is not terraformed as a part of the kinsman-redeemer process. #prayer #covenant #forgiveness #generational-sins #generational-forgiveness #kinsman-redeemer

### SOUL TIES

> [!quote]+ 
>*“After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself.”* [[1 Samuel 18_1\|1 Samuel 18:1]]* #bible-verse

Many Christians today are familiar with the concept of a “soul tie” or the knitting of two souls together as a result of a love bond. Within the context of marriage, these are intended and beautiful. Parents can have healthy soul ties with their children, called “bonding.” For the most part, these are manifestations of the Love that God created between two people and should be honored. When soul ties result from sin (fornication, idolatry, manipulation, etc.), they can be very damaging. It is possible to see the sins of one person become a stronghold of another person due to an unhealthy soul tie.   #soul-tie #love #sin  #redemption #defilement #idolatry 

The best way to break these is first to repent of your sin and forgive the other person involved with the soul tie. By hurling down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony, you break the power of the tie so it can be undone. Next you return the other persons soul, washed with the Blood of Jesus. Equally, you call back your own soul, also washed with the Blood of Jesus. This last step is often overlooked and is critical to returning each person to the state of wholeness they were in before, and with the redemption of the Blood in full effect. #forgiveness  #accuser #soul-tie #blood-of-Jesus

### SADISTIC RITUAL ABUSE (SRA)

Throughout history, satan has proven that he is void of love. No greater example exists than when humans freely choose to serve him. The resulting fruit can make a horror movie seem like child’s play. When a human becomes a servant of evil, which is the ultimate glorification of self, they are handing to the evil one

their power to create and to destroy. You see this through witchcraft and all of its esoteric, occultist, and false-religion activities. The results are horrific.  #choice #witchcraft #evil-one 

Satan has formalized his process of leeching power from humans through ancient rituals. These can be found in pre-flood hedonism, and in every Assyrian, Sumerian, Babylonian, Mayan, Celtic, and ancient Chinese religion since the flood. Some are worse than others. The absolute worst involve the infliction of trauma through pain, suffering, humiliation, and sometimes the death of innocent victims. Today we refer to these as Sadistic Ritual Abuses (SRAs). They are hidden from the public view, often conducted by people of renown / heroes of old (those with influence), and are covered up and renounced by the secular psychiatric community. #love #choice #evil-one #witchcraft #SRA #not-love 

The victims are usually, but not always, children aged 5 - 10. The ritual is conducted in a dark place that almost always includes the shedding of blood (animal or human) and some sort of sexual humiliation (physical violation or forced oral). The objective is severe trauma that silences the person and renders them docile or even willing to accept future abuses. In our experiences, the involvement of a “trusted” family member is especially common. The worst case SRA will include a human sacrifice, consumption of blood, and a marriage to satan himself. The resulting stronghold is massive, complex, and brings utter destruction to the person’s life. The legal right of all evil to manifest on earth comes from the freewill choices of humans to rebel against the will of God. #kingdom-of-darkness #choice #not-love #rituals #SRA #legal-right #bloodshed #defilement 

To strip evil of its right to manifest, we fully forgive those humans who chose to rebel against God. As the hidden sins are revealed in the Light of His Presence, we cast down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony by forgiving the sinners. The time this process takes depends upon how much sin is revealed as a part of the victim’s daily bread given to them by God. Once the sins are forgiven and the strongholds shattered, we next yield to God’s timing and sequence for the healing of the person’s soul. God is very patient when it comes to the healing of a person afflicted by evil. He wants to deal with every part of us, our spirit, soul, and body.

As such He heals us over time giving us each day what we can handle until the job is done. Through this process we have seen numerous people regain normal function within a few sessions. After a few months, they have declared themselves healed. This is truly amazing given the severity of the trauma. Praise God for this breakthrough! #rituals #SRA  #blood #evil-one #satan #freedom #choice #sin #light-of-jesus  #forgive #daily-bread #testimony

## Chapter 13: The Final Frontier
 #chapter #rescue #freewill #love #not-love #forgiveness 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."”[[Luke 23_34a\|Luke 23:34a]]* #bible-verse 

We know our bodies. They have been with us since we were born and our memories began. As we mature mentally, our bodies do the same growing from a small stature to a larger one. Our body is on earth, it is visible, and we can tangibly see when something goes wrong with it through symptoms. Our spirit is another matter altogether. Our spirit is invisible (by the natural eye) and is seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus ([[Ephesians 2_6\|Eph. 2:6]]). Learning to operate out of our spirit primarily is a topic for another time. For now, let’s suffice to say that the part of us that is seated with God is receiving from God, and therefore should be leading our being. #bible-verse #spirit 

The soul (mind, will, emotion) is our weak spot. Like our body, it is on earth, yet the soul is invisible. We are born with the ability to use it, but like our body, we develop it over time. Not surprisingly, it is the invisible part that the enemy uses against us. This is the part of our being that must be set free, delivered, and healed for us to walk in the fullness of our calling. While this may seem simple, it is actually far from it. Our soul develops habits of behavior over time that become a significant part of our personality. It affects how we perceive inputs, what choices we make, and our basic temperament. Although the emotions and especially the mind are a big part of this, it is the will that houses the part of us that will either be Love or not Love. #soul #choice #change #journey #love #not-love #maturity

The final frontier for the people of God is our freewill which is constantly being deceived by the evil one. Hurling down the accuser allows us to pull the plug on the power in the building and unlock the door. But it is up to the prisoners to choose to leave the prison or it is all for naught. Even with the Light on, human beings can remain blind if we choose not to open our eyes. Before we move on with more advanced topics, we must understand and then master the process of bringing Truth to people so they are not left behind. War has always been a team based sport. Individual accomplishment is important for the sake of contribution, but if the team loses, we all lose. The stakes are eternity so we have no room for error. Failure means the ultimate penalties for the lost. There can be absolutely, positively, no stragglers.

### PREDESTINATION

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them. To one he gave five talents of money, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.” [[Matthew 25_14-15\|Matt. 25:14-15]]* #bible-verse 

God created each of us to be unique and different, but He loves us all the same. To say that we are created the same, however, is not correct. When we were created, the Lord predestined us for a specific calling that is different from our neighbor’s. To some He gives more gifting. To others, less, each according to the calling that the person was created for. The perversion of this truth of the Lord is when the enemy deceives people into believing that entire races of humans are superior or inferior and justify any kind of behavior that is “not love” under this lie. The truth is that each individual is loved the same, but gifted quite differently. #love #gift #truth #not-love #choice #journey

>*“But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed say to him who formed it, ‘Why have you made me like this?’ Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?” [[Romans 9_20-21\|Romans 9:20-21]]* #bible-verse

It is so important that we remember our responsibility to avoid judgement, that is, avoid deciding the eternal fate of any human being for benefit (heaven) or detriment (hell). That is not our job, it belongs to Jesus. When Paul discusses honor and dishonor, or mercy and wrath, or noble and common purposes, he is talking about a person’s role on earth within time and what fruit is produced for the overall benefit of the Kingdom of God. Just as the Lord gave ten talents to one person but only one talent to another, each according to their ability. It is contrary to the teaching of Jesus to judge that Pharaoh and Esau (all from Romans 9) are in hell just because “Esau I hated” and because the purpose of Pharaoh’s birth was to show the power of God. #heaven #hell #jesus #kingdom #journey #fruit #judgment 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“...for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.” [[Romans 11_29\|Romans 11:29]]* #bible-verse

A person must choose from their own freewill to obey God, accept His invitation, fulfill that which is expected, and respond to the proposal with “I do.” In short, we must say “yes” to God when He calls or we will miss our destiny. Jonah was predestined to minister to the people of Nineveh. Until he changed his answer from “no” to “yes” he did not walk in this destiny. Due to the impact of his calling, the Lord went out of His way to push the issue, but Jonah still made a free choice. So must we all. #choice #freewill #invitation #heart-of-God 

Our will is not predestined to say “yes” to God. We are free to choose Love or not love. Certainly it is correct that God knows what choices we will make. It is His prerogative to invest more into the lives of those persons that will choose well. But that does not influence our freedom to choose. Only His calling on our lives and the gifts He gives us to accomplish this calling are predestined and irrevocable. That is, we can operate with these gifts for their intended purposes regardless of whether we operate within the Will of the Father or not. It is imperative that we do ([[Matthew 7_21-23 \|Matt. 7:21-23]]) for eternal fruit to be produced for the Kingdom of God, but if we do not, God will not revoke the gift or the call. #bible-verse #love #not-love #invitation  #journey   #fruit #kingdom #father #gift #choice  #heart-of-God

Nonetheless, we cannot identify our will as being the source of our salvation. We are not saved by works, they are a byproduct of the Holy Spirit within us. The one and only source of our salvation is Christ Jesus who fully met the requirements of the law of God on our behalf ([[Romans 8_3-4\|Rom. 8:3-4]]). If our will makes the eternal choice of Love, we still must give God the glory for having access to eternal life through the Lamb of God. #bible-verse #identity #salvation #holy-spirit #jesus #choice #glory

>*“Then the man who had received the one talent came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground.* *See, here is what belongs to you.' His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant!’” [[Matthew 25_24-26a\|Matthew 25:24-26a]]*  #bible-verse 

 
A strategy of the evil one is to deceive men and women of God into burying their gifts in the ground to avoid entering into heresy. This fear of error has paralyzed many in the Body of Christ in this day. While it is good practice to watch for any and all deception, sons and daughters of God who have received the Holy Spirit and have submitted all to God will trust Him for everything, including protection from heresy. Our intimate relationship with the Lord gives us the reassurance that we can walk down any path, no matter how it looks from our standpoint. The question is, did the Lord ask you to walk down the path? If so, say “yes” and go. #evil-one #sons-and-daughters #shame #fear #gift #church #holy-spirit #intimacy #relationship #trust

The Lord is desperate for the remnant to become a sea again. He wants every person on earth to choose Love over not love. The theology that God has predetermined who goes to heaven and who does not fails to reflect the heart of God. Our Lord cries out for the lost sheep. Jesus was adamant in His communication with Peter about feeding His lambs.  He died for the sins of all

that none should perish. If a single human spirit is lost to the Kingdom simply because that person failed to receive the gift of Jesus Christ, the Lord laments with agony. We should too. #heart-of-God #His-will #rescue #calling 

When we understand the heart of the Father, we remember that He rejoices at the return of the prodigal sons. He also wants the prodigal’s brother to share His heart and rejoice as well. We are a family, and so everything that belongs to our Father also belongs to us. Without our lost siblings we are less than what we were created to be. As adult children, we begin to see creation with the eyes of our Father. It is not His creation that we are fighting for a position of status or a quantity / quality of possessions. It is OUR creation that we share with our family. When the family loses, we lose. When the family gains, we gain. #heart-of-God #His-will #jesus #father #spirit #kingdom #creation #rescue #calling 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The Lord is not slack concerning His promise...but is long- suffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.” [[2 Peter 3_9\|2 Peter 3:9]]* #bible-verse 

All of this is to say that our mindset must be focused on realizing that what is done in heaven may not be done on earth in our time. We cannot allow our decisions and actions to be influenced towards laziness just because something is done in heaven, is the Will of God, and has been proclaimed as truth on the earth. The journey from Egypt to the Promised Land should have been 40 days. It took 40 years. Equally, the maturing of the Church of Jesus Christ from infancy to adulthood could have taken 20 years. It has taken 2,000 years. We are the generation that will fulfill the prophesy of Jesus that the prince of this world will be defeated, his prisoners released, and the Kingdom of God established. We have a vested interested in this happening. It is our family. We are the Kingdom of God on earth. #heaven #earth #His-will #seasons #maturing #jesus #kingdom #god 

### DECEPTION

*“You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” [[John 8_44\| John 8:44]]* #bible-verse

Needless to say, it is the evil one’s full time job to deceive the Body of Christ into believing ANYTHING but the truth. Why? Because his kingdom depends upon it. As long as the children of God never grow up, there is nothing to replace him. Through the power of our tongues as children of God created in His image, we can become his drones that build and maintain his empire indefinitely. He wants his kingdom to last forever ([[Isaiah 47_7\|Isa. 47:7]]), which is possible ([[Isaiah 47_12\|Isa. 47:12]]), but will not happen ([[Isaiah 47_15\|Isa. 47:15]]). He wants to tempt the humans of earth with sweetness of sugar-coated, harmful choices. Once the sugar has melted away with digestion, what is left is the revelation of the lie: the choice was not truly sweet, but terribly bitter. When the ultimate revelation of truth comes at death, the devil discards the dead battery in the trash and replaces them with a living vessel that can be deceived until their death. There is no Love whatsoever in the kingdom of darkness. We are used, abused, and then thrown away. #bible-verse #evil-one #truth #god #not-love #kingdom #deception #choice #kingdom-of-darkness

>*“He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.'”* [[Luke 16_27-28\|Luke 16:27-28]]* #bible-verse  

This is where we make our stand. We are fighting for the freewill choices of our siblings who are deceived and lost. Our job is not to disrupt their freedom of choice, but to remove the deception of the enemy that influences them towards harmful choices that seem beneficial. By bringing Truth to them now, they have the best opportunity of avoiding “*this place of torment*” when the Truth is ultimately revealed in death. #deception #rescue #freedom #choice #truth #freewill 

Jesus spoke this out on the cross ([[Luke 23_34\|Luke 23:34]]) when He asked the Lord to forgive mankind for its actions. We do not realize what we are doing. The enemy has blinded us to the Truth and is allowing us to take the blame. But it is the heart of our Father that we all be saved. The atonement from the Lamb of God was intended for every person created. Daddy is looking to His adult children to bring His Will from heaven to earth. To see It established as His Word. #bible-verse #freewill #freedom #choice #truth #heart-of-God #jesus #father #sons-and-daughters #His-will #heaven #earth #relationship #adult-season

### HARD HEARTS

*“They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.” [[Ephesians 4_18-19\|Ephesians 4:18-19]]* #bible-verse

The challenge of our calling comes with the reality that many people are so deceived that they want to be in darkness and will resist the Light. Some are addicted to the sweetness of the sugar- coating, while others are wounded and consider the deception to be a defense against further pain. Others still are fully deceived. They have no idea that they are walking in the fog of the lies of satan. God gives us grace to repent, but if we do not, the all consuming fire will reveal the Truth publicly. This can be through the exposure of a man of God hiding in sin, or the judgement of a nation lost to the Lord for portraying goodness on the outside, while inside it is rotten to the core. #deception #deliverance #light-of-jesus #rescue #grace #fire #revelation #truth #judgment #repentance #rejection 

No matter what the reason why their heart has become hardened, they are still highly desired members of our family. They are unique creations with gifts and a calling that the Kingdom needs. Like them, we were once lost but now are found. The Lord wants them back and so do we. But if our mandate is to never override the will of another person, as this sets us up as a false god in their lives (idolatry and witchcraft), how do we rescue these lost sheep?  #heart #darkness #light #deception #truth #sin #judgment #witchcraft  #idolatry  #gifts #kingdom #heart-of-God

When Jesus delegated to us the authority to forgive sins through the Holy Spirit within us, He did not replace the need for repentance in the lives of those we forgive. Without repentance, their condition could end up being worse than it was before we forgave them. This did not stop Jesus from setting the captives free, but it is an important consideration as we learn to move in the commission that Jesus has sent us with. This authority was

See chapter 18 on Dismantling for details on how to pray for a person with a hardened heart. The key is when we ask the Lord for intervention in their lives. While we can break the power of the enemy’s hold on their lives, we ultimately need His revelation of Truth to snap the person out of the trance that they are held in. Demons must be replaced with loyal angels to protect them and minister life to their damaged hearts. They need to be covered in His incubator of grace that the upper hand of the Kingdom of God would prevail in their lives. #jesus #authority  #forgiveness #sin #holy-spirit #maturity  #wisdom #pray #revelation #truth #demons #grace #kingdom #angel #rescue

## Chapter 14: Bread Crumbs
 #chapter #His-will #journey #hebrew 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;* *to search out a matter is the glory of kings.” [[Proverbs 25_2\|Proverbs 25:2]]*   #bible-verse 

In the summer of 2006, the Lord began stretching Shari and me greatly. We had both grown up with Christian values that were based upon love and focused upon sanctification through repentance (a very good thing). Yet the Lord was taking us to a place deeper within His heart. This place was outside of our understanding of how God moved. As such we were very concerned that the supernatural events occurring around us were not God and could be an attempt of the enemy to get us to stray from the Truth.  #heart-of-God #supernatural #truth #trust #His-will #journey 

We attended a conference that July where a significant amount of gold was appearing out of nowhere. Not seeing the point of this within our belief system (no one was repenting), we were ready to walk out when the Lord said to us both, “*Trust Me*.” We did not know the person speaking who was calling for this gold to appear, but we did know the Lord. When we agreed to trust Him, it made room for Him to show us something we had never seen before. And that is exactly what happened. From that day forward the Lord was free to do anything He wanted in our lives. We trusted Him with all that we were. #trust #His-will

One way that the Lord speaks to us is with tiny individual events that could easily be dismissed as “insignificant life” or coincidence. The time on a clock, the weather, the word or statement of a total stranger, a fleeting thought, a gift, or even your own birthday are all examples. But when you have opened yourself to the Lord and allow Him to do what He wants to in your life, these things begin to connect as language. We call these “Bread Crumbs.” They are tiny events left on the path in front of you by a loving Father who is directing you deeper into His heart. Follow the Bread Crumbs and you’ll know Him with an ever growing level of intimacy. Pick up the Bread Crumbs and you’ll notice that they are shaped like jigsaw puzzle pieces. Place each one on the table and wait. One day you’ll get another one that fits it perfectly. Over time they begin to form a picture. The Lord is speaking to you! He is revealing to you more and more of who He is and who you are! What an adventure it is to be walking with the Lord! He has much to say to us. The adventure begins when we choose to listen.  #invitation #His-will #bread-crumb #heart-of-God #adventure #listen 

### HEBREW

When opening your eyes to Bread Crumbs left by the Lord, it is extremely helpful to understand a few things about the language of Hebrew. First of all, be advised that Hebrew does not translate into English directly, but must be transliterated. This is primarily due to the fact that each Hebrew letter has multiple meanings while an English (Latin) letter has only a corresponding sound. Hebrew letters can be understood using either rabbinic (traditional) or Kabbalah (mystical) methods, the latter of which is not something I am promoting in this writing. But I believe that it is very important for Christians to understand the language that Jesus spoke and studied throughout His life and how it differs from our own language.

For example, the Hebrew letter for “D” (pronounced *[[dalet\|dalet]]*) and represented as d also has the pictorial meaning of a gate or door, and can represent poverty or neediness. There are no numbers in Hebrew, so letters each have a corresponding number. The numeric value of “D” is four (4). Now imagine a five letter word with each letter having at least three potential meanings and a numeric value. One word could be translated 15 different ways. The good news is that most words have common meanings so a sentence can be understood with confidence. The revelation for the English speaking world is that the language is truly very rich and has much to offer us in understanding our Lord and Savior. #hebrew/word #dalet #gate #door #bread-crumb 


### FOUR SEVEN

Larry Palmer and I went on a trip in June (2009) to Colorado as directed by the Lord. We had no idea why we were going, and were given less than 24 hours advance notice before leaving. On our first day there I took a digital picture of Larry in front of a massive outcropping of rocks on the land where our former house is. I noticed on my camera that it was picture #147 and that the time I took it was 10:47 am. I told Larry this and he said, “Wow. You took the 147th picture of a man born in 1947 at 10:47 am.” The brand of pants I was wearing that day was “Element 47.” We then continued on our day for a few hours, sang a few songs, and then headed back to the town where our hotel was for dinner. In the car I noticed that the temperature outside was 47 degrees. When we got to the hotel there was a building next door that housed the corporate headquarters of a radio station, “104.7 FM.” The Lord had our undivided attention...

The first song we sang up on the mountain was called “Hail.” My son and I wrote it in April (2009). The words are a quotation of [[Job 38_22\|Job 38:22]]. We pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant next to our hotel and there in the grass was freshly fallen hail. After dinner we had an email from one of our intercessors in the Oklahoma City area.   She told us to look at Psalm 147, #bible-verse

>*“He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can withstand his icy blast?” [[Psalm 147_17\|Psalm 147:17]]* #bible-verse 

There are times when the Lord puts pieces together in such a way that it “blows our minds.” We literally had no idea why we went to Colorado, but so many things were falling into place and so quickly. Sometimes this happens so fast, you don’t have time to chronicle all that He is doing. But we know it is Him and we get to trust Him to complete the picture being drawn by the joining of the jigsaw puzzle pieces in His timing. So we rested in what He was doing and watched as the pieces came together.

>*“I will give you the treasures of darkness, riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the LORD, the God of Israel, who summons you by name.” [[Isaiah 45_3\|Isaiah 45:3]]* #bible-verse 

Back when we were in New Orleans (April 2009), one of our Tulsa based intercessors received revelation from the Lord about our accessing the storehouses mentioned in Job 38. Those that were buried by the Lord under snow and hail for times of war and battle. The scripture she received was [[Isaiah 45_3\|Isa. 45:3]]. #bible-verse 

In Hebrew the number seven (7) corresponds to the letter “Z” (pronounced *zayin*). The pictorial representation is that of a sword while the number itself means wholeness or completeness. We therefore saw the numbers four and seven as being the wholeness of a gate or a completed door. From the standpoint of land, this spoke to us regarding the cleansing of the gates into a city or nation. We certainly saw this on our trip to New Orleans.  #hebrew/word #zayin #wholeness #completion #gate #door

The Father sent Jesus to be the gate through which all come to be saved. Jesus then sent us ([[John 20_21\|John 20:21]]) to be the gates through which His salvation is carried across the world. From the standpoint of people, four seven (4 & 7 or zayin & dalet) represents to us the hidden treasure we were obtaining in the spirit there in Colorado. It is God’s hidden strategy for bringing His children into wholeness. #bible-verse #hebrew/word #treasure #wholeness #discernment #spirit 

He showed us how the evil one has an ancient plan to keep the human race from ever reaching the fullness of our destiny to prevent the wedding from taking place. The enemy wants to keep the Bride from being available for marriage because she is either too young, deceived into rejecting the proposal, or dead. We received the Key to dismantle this plan while on the mountain. Element 47 (the brand of my pants) is silver, which is the last impurity that comes out of gold when it is heated. The Lord has given us the final piece to remove all impurities from our being. He wants us to be fully pure so we can see the fullness of Christ manifest in our lives! This strategy is released throughout the next few chapters. Read on! #wedding #purification #deception #evil-one #rejection #dismantle #puzzle-piece

### SNOWFLAKES IN A BLIZZARD

> [!quote]+ 
>*“No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him” [[1 Corinthians 2_9\|1 Corinthians 2:9]]* #bible-verse 

The ability to hear God’s voice and to discern His signs is a critical skill in moving into our destiny. Yet this basic requirement is only the beginning. From here, the Lord wants to train us in handling a stream of revelations from the Throne Room (downloads) and keeping these in mind when doing His work. This boot camp stretches us until we can hear His instructions on the fly and respond without hesitation. The biggest challenge is the sheer volume of input coming from Heaven. Our spirits are ready to go, but our souls and bodies cry out, “slow down Daddy, slow down!!!” #listen #discernment #revelation

When we reach the end of our training, our capacity to operate in the Lord’s timing is staggering. Each download is unique and precious like a snowflake. Each assignment is like a blizzard. There are many revelations, much to see, and much to do. We operate in teams, representing the unified body of Christ. Yet with all of these variables, we are always in the right place at the right time. He designed each of us and then prepared us to work in this environment. With His anointing on us, we perform superhuman tasks. It should be impossible, but the burden is light. #bride #revelation #light #church 

When people ask us to describe what the Lord does when we go out on assignment with Him, it is very difficult to do. Most of our trips have been over five days long with each day consisting of 20 hours of nonstop missions. We minister to people, dismantle ancient strongholds of evil in the land, teach at a conference, and sometimes lead worship to boot! We administrate last minute travel arrangements by foot, car, plane, or boat. We witness signs in the earth and sky, in the words of people we meet, and through the names of persons, places, and things. Sometimes we even get to eat! #assignment #adventure #rescue 

All of this happens in one day. Over multiple days, it can be a challenge to chronicle what happened. For this reason, when people ask “what happened when you were gone,” we respond with a sampling and say, “That is just one snowflake in a blizzard.” It is the life of an adult son or daughter of God. Those who are called are created to operate at a superhuman level. This book is written to and for those who have said, “yes” to God and are ready to lay down their lives for His higher calling. It costs you everything, but it sure is worth it. #missions #sons-and-daughters

## Chapter 15: The Last Battle

>*“But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.” [[Joshua 24_15\|Joshua 24:15]]*  #bible-verse 

Over the course of Terraforming, we have learned that the purpose of creation is to fulfill the Lord’s definition of Love which established the concept of a relationship between two or more objects. We the children of God are the object the Lord created to Love. But for us to Love Him back honestly, we must have freewill, and we cannot see Him in the natural. Otherwise, creation would not result in Love as He defined it.   #terraforming #love #relationship #heart-of-God 

We also learned that the kingdom of darkness has diabolical plans to defeat the Kingdom of God. The evil ones use the requirements of Love against us as their primary weapons. They deceive and lie to us from the dark places (we cannot see in the spirit realm with our natural eyes) to tempt us into sin that gives them valid accusations in the Throne room against us and four generations beneath us. These become legal rights that allow evil to manifest on earth, increasing their power. Their lies have also resulted in a religious infrastructure that allows a few to enter the Kingdom of Jesus (inevitable), but keeps the children of God from ever reaching the fullness of their calling. They don’t want us to begin, much less complete our mission of #freewill #choice #evil-one #sin #accusation #legal-right #jesus #kingdom

overcoming their power and then lovingly ushering our brethren into the Kingdom of God.

We have learned the basic tenant that if sin gives the evil ones power, then to break that power we must forgive the sinners. As a royal priesthood, we have been called to go into the world with the same authority and calling that Jesus received from the Father. We carry the Blood of Jesus to bring His forgiveness to these sinners (including ourselves) so that the legal rights of the enemy will be stripped. Speaking the word of our testimony of what the Blood of the Lamb has done for us, we hurl down the accuser against us and our siblings. We realize our identity as sons and daughters of God, called to corporately mature into adults who are responsible enough to receive the authority the Lord wants to delegate to us. We will do greater works than Jesus did. But we must attain the fullness of our calling in Christ. Nothing less is acceptable. #sin #evil-one #royal-priest #authority #blood #jesus #sons-and-daughters #forgiveness 

### SPLINTER SOULS

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.” [[Psalm 11_2\|Psalm 11:2]]*

Within the soul, the mind of a human being is subject to significant trauma at the hands of our brothers and sisters. The evil one learned this early on: that by having people do his dirty work for him, a person’s heart can be “broken” from the indescribable pain of betrayal, abandonment, neglect, isolation, and rejection. A broken heart results in a wounding that has crippling effects on a person’s mental state. The wounding produces fear and anger, which fuel further sins that separate us from our God and provide legal rights for the evil one to gain power.  #soul #evil-one #heart #not-love #mental-health #legal-right #wound 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.” [[James 4_8\|James 4:8]]*  #bible-verse

When a person’s soul is wounded, it splinters into multiple parts. These have been identified by psychiatrists as “multiple personality (MPD),” “split personality (DID),” “bipolar,” and in

worse cases, “schizophrenia.” But the Lord has identified the benefit to the kingdom of darkness of this trauma that has not been understood before now. Each of these splinters of the soul has a part of the mind, a part of the emotions, and most importantly, a part of the **will**. As such, each splinter can operate out of its wounding with the insistence of meeting its own needs / wants. #mental-health #wound #trauma #self-protection 

The Lord gave me the first example of this with my own life. When I was a child I was traumatized at the age of five or six. The splinter that resulted never grew up and was characterized by self pity and despair. The next splinter occurred during my adolescent years when I was around 14. That happened from the long-term “chipping away” torture of having to get up early, go to school, and feel imprisoned most of the day. I felt no liberty at all. This splinter manifested as a rebel who wanted his way or the highway. The sins were resentment, disrespect, and self salvation. #mental-health #wound #splinter #soul #sin #trauma 

Next the Lord revealed to me the splinter that occurred at the same time as the rebel. This one was looking for self pleasure to replace the pain it was in. It was characterized as an addict and was attached to all of the usual suspects (sex, drugs, alcohol, rock and roll). The last one the Lord revealed to me did not manifest until I was in my 20’s. This was the bully whose job was that of a bodyguard. The bully protected me from further rejection, betrayal, or false accusation through using the irrevocable gift God had given me (verbal authority), to shut down any attempt to harm me (especially the little child within me). The sins were anger and self preservation. #self-sourcing #self-protection #splinter #root 


> [!quote]+ 
>*“So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. For in my inner being I delight in God's law; but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!” [[Romans 7_21-25a\|Romans 7:21-25a]]* #bible-verse 

Since the last splinter occurred, I grew mightily in the Lord. The main part of my soul grew into a massive man of God who had repented and forgiven generations of people for their sins that

were affecting my life. Yet when the revelation of the Lord came to me and I began to monitor the behavior of these splinters, I realized the power that was within them. When someone or some event would “trigger” a reaction from the splinter, it was as if I were a different person. When Shari did something that my soul perceived as being hurtful, I would fall into a powerful self pity and despair. Later when I came into my “right mind” I could honestly say that my behavior earlier was childish. Like a five or six year old who had never grown up. #splinter #repentance #generational-sins #generational-forgiveness

I literally watched my body members operate in direct opposition to my heart’s desire. When someone made a plan that I believed was a bad move, I felt an irresistible urge to resign or sabotage them by allowing mistakes to be made. All actions perceived were irrational and contradictory to the man of God I truly was. After the fact this became quite frustrating as I tried to find victory through repentance and forgiveness of my forefathers and those who trespassed against me. Yet these “bottom of the barrel” sins continued despite my efforts to subdue them. #revelation #change #heart #god #generational-forgiveness #repentance 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Teach me your way, O LORD, and I will walk in your truth; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.” [[Psalm 86_11\|Psalm 86:11]]* #bible-verse

When the Lord revealed the existence of the splinters to me, and the fact that their **will **was what kept me from having victory, I saw Light in the tunnel. While I freely chose to repent and forgive, these splinters were in complete rebellion to my own decisions. Until they repented and forgave, my being was not fully free of the legal rights of the enemy. What a wretched man I was! But I knew immediately that there had to be a way in. #splinter #legal-right #revelation #will 

That which frustrated me the most was what brought the freedom. I kept looking at these souls, operating on their own as separate humans. It was like we were sharing the same brain and body, but different in so many other ways. And here is where the key was. By treating each splinter as a separate human, I had the authority to forgive them as a royal priest the same way I would forgive any other person. The Blood of the Lamb would strip the evil ones of their rights to manifest, while providing me the

testimony of restoration. What was being restored was my own soul. This broke the door wide open for complete healing. #will #light #forgiveness  #freedom #splinter #royal-priest #blood #jesus #soul #testimony #legal-right 

I prayed in the following steps. First I forgave each splinter, sprinkling them with the Blood of Jesus. I then spoke out the word of their testimony that they were purified of all unrighteousness, and redeemed of every consequence, but it was **I who was restored **to the man of God I was created to be. Whole and complete. Unified and integrated. I then had the ability to hurl down the accuser and welcome each splinter back into my being as if we had never been parted. Our souls became my soul. I was back in control to make one choice that affected my whole being. #forgiveness #blood-of-Jesus #purification #splinter 

Next, with all splinters integrated into one soul, I immediately repented for every time I pitied myself, was fearful, despaired, rebelled, resented, intoxicated myself, sought self pleasure, was angry, preserved myself, and for every time I used my Godly, irrevocable gifts for my will instead of the Father’s. I received the Blood of Jesus and spoke out the word of my testimony, hurling down the accuser. Finally, as a whole and complete man of God, I fully forgave my forefathers, all those we have been in covenant with, and all those who trespassed against us. I emphasized any person the Lord highlighted in His Light that had caused a splinter to occur. For the first time since I was a child, my whole being was in unity with forgiveness. The change in me was immediate and measurable. I felt a sense of clarity that I had not known throughout my adult life. My dreams changed radically where before they were limited to old friends and old places. Now I dream of my life today as a man of God with irrevocable gifts that I see operating for the Kingdom. People that I have met in the last few years, months, or even days appear in my dreams (rare before I was integrated). And most importantly, I do not sense my personality changing when the behavior of another person is threatening to me.  #forgive #blood-of-Jesus #splinter  #restoration #soul #generational-forgiveness #kinsman-redeemer #self-sourcing #self-protection

I found that after years of being wounded, I had learned to distrust human beings. Because of this, my soul had built up armor to protect me from further scratches and cuts (not necessarily the deep-wound threats that the bully took care of). When people wanted to assess me (size me up) or take from me (leeching or draining), I was virtually unreachable to the public. These “walls” had surrounded me with protection, but in the process had isolated me from sharing who I was with my brothers and sisters around me. Only those closest to me (immediate family) knew the fullness of the “real Scott.” When I realized that these were in place, I repented, received the Blood of Jesus and hurled down the accuser. I received the protection of the Lord in its place. #self-protection #self-sourcing #soul #blood #jesus #accuser 

### SOUL VALVES

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” [[Matthew 6_10\|Matthew 6:10]]* #bible-verse

The Father’s will is done in heaven and now He wants it to be done on earth. Heaven is the source of the will of the Father and earth is the destination. The flow of the will of the Father is therefore from Heaven to earth. It is in this flow that the Lord wants to send all things to His family: inheritance, revelation, authority, and power. This is not to say that our intimacy with Him is one-sided. We have a two way relationship with the Lord. But He is all knowing and does not need a flow to see what we are doing. We are not all-knowing, until we receive from Heaven! Then we have access to everything that He provides us without limitation! #His-will  #heaven #earth #intimacy #love #inheritance #revelation #authority

>*“And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages He might show the incomparable riches of His grace, expressed in His kindness to us in Christ Jesus.” [[Ephesians 2_6-7\|Ephesians 2:6-7]]* #bible-verse 

Our spirits are seated in Heaven with Jesus right now where the Father wishes to pour into us all things that we need here on earth. From our spirit, our soul is then fed, if it is willing. The intake valve of the soul determines if, and with what quantity the soul receives from the spirit seated in Heaven. A shut or partially shut valve is literally the result of an overactive soul

that has learned to defend or uplift itself through mental understanding or emotional reactions. To turn this valve to the full open position, we must repent of *leaning on our own understanding *([[Proverbs 3_5\|Prov 3:5]]), and / or the emotions of fear, anger, and pride which led to control. We must also forgive our forefathers who most likely had the same sins. #bible-verse  #spirit #soul #generational-sins

>*“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”* [[Matthew 11_28-30\|Matthew 11:28-30]]* #bible-verse 

The out-take valve of the soul is often shut or partially shut through the internalization of burdens, false responsibilities, and stress. This creates an enormous amount of pressure within a person and can lead to depression and in some cases, auto- immune disorders. The events that surround us in life can be painful and we must have the ability to allow these to flow into us and out of us like a river and not pool up like a lake. We need to hand these burdens to Jesus. To turn this valve to the full open position, we must repent and then forgive our forefathers of fear, false standards, false expectations, and in many cases, idolatry. #heart-of-God #spirit-of-God #heaven #jesus #father #choice #fruit #forgive #generational-forgiveness 

### SOUL HABITS

>*“I am the true vine, and My Father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit He prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.” [[John 15_1-2\|John 15:1–2]]* #bible-verse 

As with deliverance, the integration of Splinter Souls through the fullness of forgiveness and repentance removes the power of the evil one to tempt, torment, or afflict us. This alone has a radical impact on our lives, especially in our ability to resist sin. Yet the years of living in these conditions creates strong personality habits, instincts, and reflexes that must be dealt with. Even though the demons are gone and the splinters are integrated, we still found ourselves automatically responding to the triggers (other humans behaving in a way that could wound or offend us) the same way we did before. It was massively different, yet the responses were there.

Although I am an adult in body and spirit, my soul was splintered into parts that were different ages depending upon when the injury occurred. Once integrated, I am now a single soul: one mind, one will, and one set of emotions. Yet within this single entity was the *behavior *of a middle-aged adult, a young adult, a teenager, and a child. To complete the healing, I must see this behavior level off to a consistent place that reflects the man of God that I am. #deliverance #splinter #forgiveness #repenting #evil-one #demons #fullness #completion 

This is the Last Battle. The breaking of these habits require the relearning of our behavior from one that is self-directed to one that is based upon Love. Our behavior must mature to a level set that is Christ-like. As easy as this sounds, it can be more painful than we think. There are beliefs that we hold on to, and actions that we have thought to be Godly, that are not. Are we willing to let go of these things in order to receive the fullness of what we were created to be? #fullness #trust #restoration  

The Lord doesn’t want us to be set free from captivity and then released to 80% of our destiny. He wants us to walk in 100%. Only then will we be trustworthy to receive all of the authority and power that He wants to delegate to us as He delegated it to Jesus. Every belief and action must be placed on the altar of God so that He can return them to you sanctified. Are we willing to agree to such a process? #love #completion #fullness #maturity #destiny #authority #freedom  

### YES

Jesus did everything for us. He demonstrated the way of the Kingdom with Truth and Power. He was wounded so we could be healed and delivered. He died so we could be saved. The eternal life of our being is solely depended upon our believing this for ourselves. Our Father has predestined us with an irrevocable calling. The Holy Spirit of Christ is within us to literally be our righteousness so we can be everything that Jesus was on earth. All that remains is our free choice of “Yes.” #jesus #choice 

Servants are commanded to obey their masters. They must say “yes” to fulfill this requirement of obedience. Friends are invited to participate in the calling. They must accept this invitation to experience that participation.  Sons and daughters

are included in everything their Father does. Participation is automatic. They will experience this calling unless they decline to participate with the word, “no.” A wife is one flesh with her Husband. Once she accepts His proposal, she is forever unified with Him. What He does, she does. #servant-covenant #friendship-covenant  #inheritance-covenant #sons-and-daughters #one-flesh #invitation 

Each level of intimacy has its own response to the call of God. Which level are you at? Is He your master, your friend, your Father, or your Husband? What choice have you made in response to your God, your Lord, your King? In the process of the transformation of our lives from a sinful nature to a Godly nature, God provides everything, but He does not force us to do anything. We must choose this day whom we will serve. We must agree with Him or not. But the choice is free and it is yours to make. #layer #intimacy #choice #invitation #calling #freewill  

### SOUL DESTINY

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.”  [[James 5_16a\|James 5:16a]]* #bible-verse 

We know that the process created by God for learning behavior is called discipline (teaching). Each of us must submit to this process to be free of sinful habits. To be healed we are called to come together and pray for one another. I recommend an accountability partner for this process. Someone you trust that you can tell about your former splinters, what their behavior was, and your desire to be free of the bad habits that remain after integration. That person should have the authority to lovingly correct you to the extent that you are willing to be set free from these habits. The boundaries that you set must be enforced for the behavior to change. Consequences will be required in some cases. Just make sure that the process you follow is founded in Love. #trust #prayer #heart-of-God #splinter #love #accountability #journey 

When you begin the journey of discovering the supernatural ways of God, the spirit begins to take its rightful place as the leader of your being, receiving from the Father everything that is needed in life. This can be threatening to the soul (mind, will, emotions) who has most likely run the show your entire life. Have your accountability partner address your soul directly. Close your eyes and have that person speak out the destiny of the

The Lord is taking us on an adventurous journey into the fullness of our calling and destiny as sons and daughters of God, unified into an adult church. We are learning that there is nothing that Jesus did that we are not called to do. In fact, He said that we would do greater works than what He did on earth! As we continue this process of identifying all things that Jesus did and seeing them in the Light of being what WE will now do, we are encouraged to push on to the fullness of Christ. We are desirous of everything that God has for us because we know that our identity in Him and our calling is far beyond our furthest expectations. It is bigger than we thought. #journey #fullness #calling #destiny #sons-and-daughters #unity #jesus #light

People after the heart of God give all to Him, so He uses us for His great will to be done. That means giving Him our ambitions, needs, even our very lives. Are you willing to lay everything you want at the feet of God? Are you willing to lay your basic needs at the feet of God? Are you willing to let your heart be broken for the Kingdom? Are you willing to be falsely accused for His testimony? Will you trust God with the lives of your children? Your spouse?

##### STEPHEN

*“Now Stephen, a man full of God's grace and power, did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people. Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)—Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia. These men began to argue with Stephen, but they could not stand up against his wisdom or the Spirit by whom he spoke.” [[Acts 6_8-10\|Acts 6:8-10]]* 

Does our commission from Jesus, which includes every way that the Father sent Him, include being crucified? Let’s look at the first martyr of the newly birthed church to see our answer. Stephen was not just a follower of the Lord, he operated in the same manner of authority that Jesus did. He then was not just stoned, but killed in a state of innocence, just as Jesus was. Stephen’s ministry and death mirror that of Jesus with significant precision. Like Jesus before him, Stephen was a son of man, filled with the Holy Spirit. What came of this? #wisdom #freedom #spirit #holy-spirit

As the Father sent Jesus to walk a righteous life, teach, preach good news, perform miracles, and to not love His life even unto death, so Jesus sent Stephen to do the same. Stephen was an example to every generation thereafter and to every age of the church of what [[John 20_21\|John 20:21]] could look like. This is not to say that we all have the destiny of martyrdom: the apostle John was not martyred. Stephen’s life serves as an example that we all should take note of.

What is the effect of martyrdom? When Jesus died, the earth received the free gift of eternal salvation. When Jesus was wounded, the earth received the gift of freedom, deliverance, and healing. So what did the earth receive when Stephen died? Losing Stephen was a blow to the early church. Certainly, the Lord did not want Stephen to be stoned to death. So what benefit could possibly come from the death of this man of God? #miracles #gift #salvation

The Lord appeared to Saul without an invitation. He imposed Himself onto Saul whereby there was no question in his mind that God was real, and His son was indeed Jesus. All things held equal, this is a major violation of The Rules. By presenting Himself in this way, the Lord took away Saul’s freewill and made a choice for him. He was blinded until he followed the Lord’s instructions to the letter. If the Lord did this for everyone, we would not be free to choose Love over not-Love. The very definition of Love is at stake. So why did the Lord do such a thing? #freewill #love #not-love #invitation

When a son of man, filled with the Holy Spirit, and rendered spotless by the Blood of Jesus is martyred (stolen from the Kingdom of God on earth), the Lord receives the legal right to replace that person with redemption and sevenfold restitution ([[Proverbs 6_31\|Prov 6:31]]). This is not the right for the birth of a human in the natural, but a right to bring someone into the Kingdom of God. That means divine intervention into the life of someone, in this case, someone with a very high call. #bible-verse  #god #freedom #freewill #love #not-love #holy-spirit #blood-of-Jesus  #legal-right 

### PAUL

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of Me and what I will show you. I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.'” [[Acts 26_16-18\|Acts 26:16-18]]* #bible-verse 

When Saul became Paul, he became the redemption of the life of Stephen. Although Stephen had great gifting and anointing on earth, the Lord replaced the loss of him with one that was given far greater responsibilities than Stephen had. Paul was commissioned to set the captives free from the deception of the evil one, and to release them into their “place” or destiny in the Kingdom of God. In the end, he wrote most of what we refer to as the “New Testament” through his letters to the churches. Paul’s writings are considered to be a road map for every person

>*“So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of His grace by enabling them to do miraculous signs and wonders.” [[Acts 14_3\|Acts 14:3]]* #bible-verse 

Paul’s ministry started very similar to Stephen’s. He traveled extensively and preached the good news of Jesus Christ. He taught on the ways of God and how to live and conduct themselves. He showed great wisdom in his dealings with every person, especially the Pharisees and the Sadducees. He demonstrated the Kingdom of God through miraculous signs and wonders, leading many to Jesus. He was hated by the teachers of the law. #redemption #destiny #kingdom #jesus 

Soon Paul’s ministry transitioned to the founding of churches throughout Asia Minor and Greece. As this chapter unfolded, Paul began to take on the role of father to these church bodies. He was viewed with great authority as the person who lead many of the original church members to Christ. Paul was also the one who followed up with wisdom and instruction on how to live life as an individual and corporately in this new revelation of the Truth of God. For the Jews, this meant the fulfillment of many covenants and the introduction of a new covenant. For the Gentiles, this meant grafting-in to a Hebrew way of life of which they had little understanding. #steward #destiny #truth

>*“Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you. But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have.

What do you prefer? ****Shall I come to you with a whip****, or in love and with a gentle spirit?”* *[[1 Corinthians 4_18-21\|1 Corinthians 4:18-21]]* #bible-verse 

Once Paul had brought the message of salvation to people and the freedom that came from the power of the name and Blood of Jesus, he next focused on the process of fathering the church into righteousness. This meant outlining the life of loving God first, and then our brothers. He had to confront the mistakes and blatant choices of members in the body to pollute The Way or

promote their own self agendas. Although less desirable, it was Paul’s calling to be the father figure in their lives. It was his job to be the final word that enforced the boundaries of conduct that kept them on the right path towards wholeness in Christ. #authority #wisdom #truth #salvation  #steward

He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.” [[2 Corinthians 13_1a-3\| 2 Corinthians 13:1a-3]]* #bible-verse 

Just as we are free to create accountability partnerships with those in the brethren that will help us to walk a straight line, our spiritual fathers have a role to play as well. The Lord is preparing many to become fathers to the church now that it has reached adulthood. Those people will give birth to new revelations, new breakthroughs, and new levels of authority for the Body of Christ to walk in. Each person who desires to achieve completeness, wholeness, or fullness in Christ will submit to these fathers for accountability and discipline. #accountability #steward #relationship #trust #change #heart-of-God 

The people of God must move past the relationship of servant and friend and into the covenant of family (inheritance). Here the believer will complete the work of sanctification through complete submission to God. The Holy Spirit reveals to us those root sins that give evil its rights to tempt, torment, and afflict us. Forgiveness through the Blood of Jesus and the word of our testimony will set us free. Those called to be fathers will undergo deep levels of cleansing so they will be worthy of the responsibility of guarding the gates to the city of God (His sheep). They will then represent the father on earth to love the flock to purity through honest confrontation of those habits that remain. Our submission to these fathers is critical for the Body to attain perfection. In this place we will be trustworthy to walk in the fullness of our calling. #inheritance-covenant #holy-spirit #root #sin #forgiveness  #authority #wholeness #fullness #relationship #purification #blood-of-Jesus #heart-of-God

## Chapter 17: One New Man
#chapter #jewish #hebrew 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two *[Jew and Gentile]*, thus making peace, and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.”* [[Ephesians 2_15b-16\|Ephesians 2:15b-16]]*  #bible-verse 

The early church fathers dealt with several serious issues resulting from the fact that they were Jews (as was Jesus), but the Gospel was available to all people. Should the Gentile converts have to be circumcised? Should they observe the High Holy Days? Should they observe the Sabbath? Should they follow every letter of the law? Would this overwhelm the Gentiles and keep them from Christ? Was this God’s will? 

Having overcome this obstacle with the solution of allowing the Gentiles freedom from having to learn and observe Jewish customs, the church was able to grow fast. But was it the intention of this policy to continue as the church matured? Once a person was born again and baptized in the Holy Spirit, the sanctification process began. After this, for the person to grow deep in the Lord there is great benefit that comes from the context and language of the Hebrew people and their history. A sign of this is the existence of the “Old Testament” which the church founders knew as scripture. These books endured long after their death to fulfill this very need. #holy-spirit #freedom #salvation #hebrew

<p style="text-align:center;">

Yet the Gospel has been encased around the religion of Christianity where circumcision has resurfaced (health benefits), the holy days are Christmas and Easter, the Sabbath has moved from Friday / Saturday to Sunday, and our standards are set by Paul, not the law of Moses. Still, this environment has successfully raised the church to adulthood, although taking 2,000 years to get here.

What would happen if the adult men and women of God who recognize Jesus as the King of Kings were to put aside religion and simply be who they were created to be? What if we adopted the Hebrew heritage that God provided, along side the freedom that Jesus bought us? Is there value to us returning to these roots as we continue on to perfection? If the Lord created the Jew and Gentile to be one new man, how can we achieve perfection without our Jewish brothers? #religion #freedom #jesus #god 

### BROTHERS

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.” [[Romans 10_1\|Romans 10:1]]* #bible-verse

The first people to believe that Jesus was the Messiah were Jews. The church was founded by Jews and it was the Jewish people that the church fathers preached to first. It was in the heart of every one of these elder brothers that we have in the Lord to see the Jewish people enter into the fulfillment of the covenants that God gave to them by birth. They, if anyone, had the deepest understanding of the mysteries of the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and King David. They held the big picture of what Jesus accomplished through the cross. And yet so many rejected Jesus as savior and continued to persecute the Jewish founding fathers of the church. #church #hebrew #jewish #god #jesus

Peter was the apostle sent to preach to the Jews ([[Galatians 2_7\|Gal. 2:7]]). Jesus knew this and so singled him out at His last visit with His apostles. The way the gospels are written, it can be difficult to read the emotion of the person talking. But rest assured, Jesus was imparting his heart to Peter in this moment. He was imploring Peter and those of us who followed Peter to not forget His brothers, who were the Jews. Yes, Jesus did mean all people, but as with all things Hebrew, this covenant He was making with Peter was also directed specifically to the Jews. They are Jesus’ brethren. They are on His heart always. They should be on ours as well. #bible-verse #heart-of-God #invitation #jewish #jesus 

### STUMBLING BLOCKS

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Then they *[Jews of the Synagogue of the Freedmen] *secretly persuaded some men to say, ‘We have heard Stephen speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God.’ So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin. They produced false witnesses, who testified, ‘This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law. For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will **destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us**.’” [[Acts 6_11-14\|Acts 6:11-14]]* #bible-verse 

Jewish persecution began at the time of Joseph and continues to this day. Since the enslavement by Egypt around the year 1900 BC, Jews have feared having their heritage, customs, and way of life forcibly taken from them. It is at the heart of every Jewish man or woman to fervently defend this way of life no matter the cost. Bless the Jews! They are zealous for the Lord! It is in their DNA to defend the everlasting covenants that the Lord made with their forefathers. #jewish #covenant 

And sure enough, the very thing that they feared most came to reality in the centuries following the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now it is very true that this persecution of identity came strongly from the Moors (who were muslims) throughout

the last 1,400 years. But it is also true, and highly overlooked, that the worst of this persecution came from the same Catholic Church that much of Christianity originates from today. #history #religion 

In Spain, this persecution originated by the Christian, Germanic Visigoth tribes who invaded in the 5th century AD. The persecutions came and went and were inflicted by various ruling majorities over the next 1,000 to 1,500 years. The primary demands made by Christians of the Jews were that they be baptized into the Catholic Church, and relinquish the laws and customs handed down to them by Moses (Jewish customs and heritage) or face death. This became the Spanish Inquisition. Everything that the Jews feared the most was being inflicted upon them by the very people who Jesus called to feed, to tend, and to love. #not-love #choice #jewish #history 

Today, Jews look at Christianity and see a religion that is steeped in pagan influences. They do not see the new covenant that God has offered them for the atonement of their sins. They see a Greek centered new testament (contract) that requires them to lose their identity that is tied to everlasting covenants with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and David, and lasting ordinances with Moses. With this outward appearance, the Jews will continue to reject that which has caused them much injury for thousands of years. They are rejecting the manmade religion and by default, missing the free gift of the salvation that only comes from God through Yeshua Ha’Mashiach (Jesus the messiah).  #religion #jewish #covenant #gift #salvation #jesus 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“One man's faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him. Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.” [[Romans 14_2-4\|Romans 14:2-4]]* #bible-verse 

There is a picture of life in Christ that is worth painting for those who pursue perfection in the Lord. On this canvas, adult men and women of God who are free to eat what we want, celebrate what we want, and worship when we want, will look at how it affects our brothers. We will question if Christmas and Easter are causing our brothers to stumble. #jesus #freedom #religion

We will ask if eating pork and bloody meat is an offense to those that Jesus cried out for. We might even investigate whether the appointed assemblies of the Lord (Leviticus 23) have value in understanding our own Savior and the times we live in. Is there benefit to us embracing these and ending the long standing mindset of rejecting and replacing them? 

When the people of God are set free from captivity of the kingdom of darkness through the revelation of the Holy Spirit and by the forgiveness of the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony, our lives will change dramatically. When we are healed of every habit of sin that was formed over years of temptation, torment, and affliction, we will be ready for power and authority. Then when we unify, Jew and Gentile, under the banner of the Lord, called Jesus (Latin / English), Yesous (Greek), or Yeshua (Hebrew), we will be ready for marriage. This is our destiny: adults walking in unity under the banner of the Lord. Yielding to His every word. It is in this place that we will see, hear, and conceive, His definition of Love. #love #jesus #healed #sin #destiny #marriage #greek #hebrew

## Chapter 18: Dismantling
#chapter #generational-forgiveness #generational-sins #dismantle #terraforming #witchcraft 

*“‘In that day,’ declares the LORD, ‘I will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots. I will destroy the cities of your land and tear down all your strongholds. I will destroy your witchcraft and you will no longer cast spells. I will destroy your carved images and your sacred stones from among you; you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands. I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles and demolish your cities. I will take vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations that have not obeyed me.’”* [[Micah 5_10-15\|Micah 5:10-15]] #bible-verse 

There are two ways of dismantling anything. The first is to take it apart the way it was put together. This is the safe way of dismantling as it limits any collateral damage. But it requires that you understand each step of the creation process whereby you can perform these steps in reverse. The extra time it takes to understand the construction can be a nuisance, but it is well worth the effort. This kind of dismantling is preferred if there is any chance of your changing your mind during or after the procedure. #dismantle 

The second way of dismantling is to demolish. Far more destructive by nature, demolition is knocking, beating, crushing, or exploding something into smaller parts. By definition this requires no knowledge of the object’s construction unless you

are attempting an efficient demolition process, and thereby not using excessive force. It is generally understood that demolition is a permanent form of dismantling, therefore changing one’s mind during or after the process is futile. You will probably get laughed at.  #dismantle 

The Lord is calling us to undertake a combination both of these. We are learning all about the objects of our dismantling as if we were going to take them apart the way they were put together. We are obtaining an expert level of understanding about their inner workings, how they were put together, and why. With this knowledge we are called to demolish the objects, but to do so with wisdom so as to maximize the sinner’s safety. This chapter discusses the process whereby we will begin the dismantling project. Everyone is invited to participate. We need your eyes. #calling #invitation 

The Lord gave us an excellent outline in Micah 5 about what we will be dismantling. The enemy has cities, strongholds, horses and chariots, witchcraft, and god status to its advantage. All of these were granted to them through their deception of humans, who in turn have sinned and given the evil ones puppet strings with which to control their power to create. We know that it is simple for us to shut all of this down: when the Light reveals the roots, we forgive the sinners with the Blood of the Lamb and then hurl down the accuser with the word of our testimony. #defilement #choice #deception #light-of-jesus  #root #forgiveness 

Each of these demonic advantages (cities, strongholds, horses, etc) are described in the natural to give us a picture of what they are, but they truly exist in the spirit. Our natural eyes may not be able to see them, but they are there, are used for empowering and cementing into existence the kingdom of darkness, and must be dismantled. It is with these weapons of warfare that the enemy has been launching attacks and counter-attacks of torment and affliction on the body of Christ for thousands of years. Let’s get to know more about how they are constructed so we can dismantle them safely. Here are some examples to get us started:

### Land

Demonic cities are similar, yet differentiated from cities in the natural. Think of old town hall meetings to get a decent picture of what these are. Demons gather together in rank from lowest to highest to discuss strategy, receive orders, and carry out missions. Please do not have a picture of organized, clean, military-like control in this environment. It looks more like a dark cavern of creepy, crawling, chaos. The city I discovered under Las Vegas, Nevada comes to mind. There are literally millions of demons in a city of this size, working together and yet not working together, if you know what I mean. They follow orders, but each has its own agenda. #demon #supernatural #discernment 

Most if not all cities in the natural have demonic counterparts in the spirit. These “sister cities” are built from the sin of the people in the natural. A good analogy comes from ants. If you leave solid food or spilt liquids on the countertop, ants will gather. This is especially true with demons. Where the sin (their food) is, they will gather. It is like moths to light. The two literally go hand in hand. There are different levels of sin that attract demons. The most authority found in these cities comes from sins of defilement which include the following: #demon #sin  #supernatural 

1. Bloodshed	[[Ezekiel 36_18\|Ezekiel 36:18]] #bible-verse 
2. Broken Covenant	[[2 Samuel 21_1-2,14\|2 Samuel 21:1-2,14]] #bible-verse 
3. Idolatry (includes witchcraft)	[[Jeremiah 16_18\|Jeremiah 16:18]] #bible-verse 
4. Sexual immorality	[[Leviticus 18_6-25\|Leviticus 18:6-25]] #bible-verse 

Demonic cities are further strengthened by the human drones. These are usually voluntary slaves, that is, witches, warlocks, and high priests. They are purposefully acting to build the city into an empire. The asherah poles of old were set by the pagan priests to set the boundaries and perimeters of the demonic city. They are found in the “highest of hills, and the lowest of valleys” to establish three dimensional territory. #watcher #demonic-stronghold #witchcraft 

Remember that demons do not create, they pervert. The land belongs to the Lord and the Kingdom of God, so all blessings in the land were put in place by Him. These are meant to work in tandem with the irrevocable gifts God gives His children. When

walking in alignment with the blessings in the land, we will see a magnification of the impact of our calling on earth. The evil one knows this and targets cities and people according to the gifts they have been given by God. Knowing that these are irrevocable, satan has lured people into using them for evil instead of Love.   #demons  #kingdom #gifts #alignment #earth #evil-one #not-love #supernatural 

An example of this can be found in New Orleans, Louisiana. Here is a city with a land blessing for prophesy. It is also a port city, and is therefore a gate of goods into the United States. In the spirit, New Orleans is a gate for prophetic words into our country. There are few U.S. cities with more organized, blatant operations of witchcraft. Here we find many gifted humans that have been deceived into conducting acts of defilement, especially idolatry and sexual immorality. The extensive demonic activity here is true in the natural city, but is also true in the size, scope, and power of the spiritual city that has been built. The enemy camp is using New Orleans as a valve to control the United States. Things look dire in our time here on earth. But in heaven, it is already done. Our Father has a plan to redeem New Orleans. The time is soon.  #gate #supernatural #witchcraft #defilement 

Demolishing demonic cities requires great authority. Although an individual adult man or woman of God who has received significant authority through a track record of hurling down the accuser can inflict a multiplier of destruction to evil, the Lord wants us to work together. Here He commands a blessing (Psalm 133). This is why the dismantling project requires the body of Christ to receive the key and begin working together to pull these cities down. #authority #unity #communion #dismantle #heart-of-God 

With everything in Terraforming, the Lord wants us to start in our own furrow. Terraforming cities requires that multiple people with high authority in the natural city (natural born residents first, transplants second) to gain authority from Terraforming their own lives. Then they can gather together in unity and Terraform their city. The important thing is to de- emphasize time. Demons obtain defilement rights and don’t lose them until the sinner is forgiven. The grace of God has overridden this in the past, but now we must change our ways ([[Acts 17_30\|Acts 17:30]]). We are wholly dependent upon the Light of Jesus to reveal the hidden sins going back in time to completely

dismantle a demonic city. With the right team of people, ordained by God, it can be done quickly and surely when the sinners are forgiven and the accuser hurled down. #forgiveness #rescue 

Tearing these down is easy in the Light, but you must be careful. The success of demons has been in stealth and deception, mainly through patiently waiting for the right opportunity to trip the warriors of Love that are battling against them. Loopholes of sin in our lives give them this target of attack. This is why we must Terraform ourselves first, and always walk in holiness. Be above reproach at all times. The health, prosperity, and sometimes the life of you and those close to you could be at risk. Keep your full armor of God on at all times (salvation, righteousness, truth, peace, faith) and you will be protected.  #dismantle #rescue #authority #adult-season #terraforming #terraformer #forgiveness #light #jesus #hidden #revelation  #truth #salvation #supernatural 

### Government

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.” [[Genesis 11_4\|Genesis 11:4]]* #bible-verse 

In the natural, the Assyrian empire worshiped handmade idols, pagan gods (demons) that they conducted detestable practices towards (bloodshed, sexual immorality) in their devotion. The authority that empowers this hierarchy comes from the unified sin of human community. When the government of that community and the agreeing majority of its inhabitants enter into corporate sin and makes it their religion, these demonic principalities receive a massive amount of rights, power, and authority to exist. #worship #demons #authority #religion #legal-right  

> [!quote]+ 
>*“‘Don't be afraid,’ the prophet answered. ‘Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.’ And Elisha prayed, ‘O LORD, open his eyes so he may see.’ Then the LORD opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.” [[2 Kings 6_16-17\|2 Kings 6:16-17]]* #bible-verse 


In the natural, the Assyrian armies rode horses pulling powerful chariots. The angelic army of God rides horses, pulling chariots of fire. These horses and chariots are assigned to the angels by the Lord as a part of their calling. As such, fallen angels ride them too. The big difference is that the chariots no longer house

the fire of God. These are sometimes used by the Lord for judgement ([[Zechariah 6_1-8\|Zech. 6:1-8]]). As with carved idols, these devices are symbolism of the demonic chain of command that is within the system of the kingdom of darkness. These are massive power houses that fall under the authority of countries, regions, and ultimately to the devil who is satan ([[Job 1_7\|Job 1:7]]). #bible-verse   #angels #demons #kingdom #darkness #satan #evil-one 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the One who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.” [[1 John 4_4\|1 John 4:4]]* #bible-verse

But do not be afraid. Those who are with us are more than those who are with them. The highest level of government within the kingdom of darkness stands upon the deception of its lying tongue. It is a house of cards. One pull and down it goes. As the body of Christ unifies in purpose, walking on the paths of our destinies with the fullness of our gifts, we see victory. The Light of Jesus reveals the hidden sins in daily portions that are the perfect quantity and sequence. We forgive the sinners, hurling down the accuser, and the hierarchy is demolished. #kingdom #darkness #deception #unity #daily-bread #revelation #light-of-jesus

In its place, the Lord will establish His government, a royal government that rests on the shoulders of King Jesus. This government consists of the adult sons and daughters of God who have an intimate relationship with their Father and operate out of a Kingdom heart. They are trustworthy to bring Love to those that need it most. They are servants who are not too proud to clean the toilets. Through Christ within them, they will embody all that Jesus was on earth: they will set the captives free and then release them on the path of their calling in the Kingdom.  #church #destiny #gifts #light #jesus #accuser #freedom #sons-and-daughters #intimacy #love #relationship #heart #heart-of-God

There is a war coming between the army of Love and the army of not-Love. Before any war can take place, there has to be preparations made to ready each side for the coming attack. Both sides are adding to their numbers both to populate the Kingdom and the kingdom and to build the armies. It is a tug of war for the hearts of human beings. There are several “push buttons” up for grabs right now, but the biggest ones are the basic needs for survival and desire for the supernatural. #love #not-love #kingdom #choice #heart #supernatural 

Recognizing these, the kingdom of darkness is rolling out its advertising program full-time. The first half of this is a recruiting promotion that has infiltrated many outlets, but none greater than the arts, especially movies. The Lord has shown us witchcraft being performed over movies when they are being made, unbeknownst to most of the movie makers. These leave seeds of evil implanted within the film itself, portals whereby the demonic hierarchies can lure unsuspecting candidates into the kingdom of darkness. They always target people by their irrevocable gifts that can be used to maximize dark power by geographical region. I will not name names, but there are several movies out that have these. We have detected the portals and have shut them down in the spirit. #kingdom-of-darkness  #heart #witchcraft #gifts #spirit #supernatural #seed #root #foundation #gate  

Most of the recruiting activities are centered around the supernatural. By enticing dreamers to join up through fantasies of sugar coated power, they are building an army with furious speed. The time to intervene is now. The kingdom of darkness is also planning more terrorist attacks, financial system failures, and even witchcraft to control the weather for more devastation that can bring about the need for basic things that they will provide to all those who join up. Those who do not (loyal Christians) would be dealt with ruthlessly. #deception #kingdom-of-darkness #supernatural #not-love 

The Kingdom of God offers eternal Love that brings indescribable fulfillment to a person. When your condition changes from not love to Love, it is quite dramatic. Pain and sorrow, fear and anger, hunger and thirst are replaced with peace, joy, happiness, and contentment. Your basic needs are not only met, but far exceeded. We also serve an omnipotent God ([[Luke 1_37\|Luke 1:37]]). He created the universe and holds it all in the palm of His hand. When the time comes, the people of God will see things

never dreamt of in human history. Those that desire to walk in the supernatural will certainly see it done and then some. #bible-verse  #supernatural #kingdom #god #love #fullness #provision #choice 

The theme with all dismantling projects is that the adult sons and daughters of God must unify together to build the authority needed to shut down the demonic hierarchies, cities in the spirit, and corporate witchcraft. As we are called to this we will lay down our lives, giving 100% of ourselves to the Lord. We will build an intimate relationship with God where we trust Him with everything, even to the risk of “heresy.” We will lose all that we’ve had in a great pruning process (including all importance in the body of Christ). We will then begin the process of building personal authority when we submit to the Light of Jesus in a daily walk of sanctification. We will offer and receive the Blood of the Lamb and hurl down the accuser with the word of our testimony. Then we will be ready to do the same for others. #dismantle #adult-season #sons-and-daughters #authority #spirit #witchcraft #intimacy #trust #church #light #blood-of-Jesus  #accuser #testimony 

### Process

With all Terraforming, we are turning to the Lord for guidance. We ask the Lord to shine His Light to reveal the hidden sins that the evil one is using as legal rights to operate. Once these have been revealed we move on to the fullness of forgiveness, where we hurl down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. In this stage, the person(s) that sinned, which can be ourselves, are forgiven. No matter what you are Terraforming, there is always a root sin and always a sinner that needs to be forgiven. With any given person that is being forgiven, there can be multiple back stories that need to be addressed. The following are four most common groups of people “behind the scenes” that should be considered when forgiving: #terraforming #terraformer #light-of-jesus #root #layer #forgiveness 

1. The person who sinned that you are forgiving (root person)
2. That person’s forefathers to the 4th generation (parents, grandparents, great-grandparents)
3. Anyone that person has been in covenant with (spouse, siblings, cousins, business partners)
4. Those that have trespassed against that person

Once these people have been forgiven with the Blood of the Lamb, we get to speak out the word of their testimony. It is by the power of the Blood that our words of dismantling are effective. Now when we say that a curse is broken, it is broken. The Holy Spirit will teach us and guide us to speak out those things that must be specifically identified to be fully rendered powerless. Therefore we can say “all curses are broken” generically if led, or “the Midianite curse is broken” if the Holy Spirit reveals this to be the case. The same goes for defilements. We can generically list, “all bloodshed, all broken covenants” or we can list specific examples if the Lord reveals these to us through prophetic pictures, memories, or signatures. #dismantle #light #evil-one #legal-right #holy-spirit #broken-covenant #revelation #generational-sins #generational-forgiveness 

### Signatures

A signature is a manifestation in the body of something that exists in the spirit. Often times this is pain in the body, specifically located in an area that describes the legal right the enemy has to torment or afflict the person with mental, emotional, or even physical sickness. In the process of receiving the revelation of these roots by the Holy Spirit in the Light of Jesus, we sometimes pick these up, translate them, forgive the person, and see total freedom or healing in the person we are praying for. These are easy to miss when you are first learning about them. Your mind can just pass them off as coincidence. But once you’ve been walking in the Light for awhile, you learn that there are few coincidences, if any. #legal-right #root #prayer 

One recent example started as pain in my lymph node. When I asked the person I was praying for if it meant anything to them, they indicated that they had been diagnosed with cancer in the very lymph node I had pain in. The Lord then gave me a picture of a forefather of that person speaking out masonic oaths. I ask them who this was and it turned out to be their grandfather. We forgave the grandfather, hurling down the accuser and dismantling the witchcraft. That person was immediately healed of arthritis in their hand. They had not been able to make a fist for 10 years, but suddenly could! A few days later during a final exam before therapy, the doctors identified that the cancer had disappeared from the body! Praise God! #generational-sins #generational-forgiveness #revelation #healing #testimony #witchcraft #legal-right #prayer #dismantle #discernment

Another example occurred during prayer. I felt a sharp pain in the sole of my right foot. We had just identified that the parents of this person were from Jamaica and we had sensed voodoo involvement. We forgave the family members, hurling down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. I then asked the person to sit down and lift up their right leg. I pulled the voodoo doll pin out of the right foot (in the spirit) and immediately the person’s right knee was healed after a failed surgery nine months previous had left them in great pain! #spirit  #revelation #root #holy-spirit  #generational-forgiveness #dismantle #witchcraft #healed #prayer #supernatural #discernment 

### Full Armor of God

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.” [[Ephesians 6_13\|Ephesians 6:13]]* #bible-verse 

Pain is no fun. No one that I know likes it. But pain reveals problems in the body, and many times, problems in the soul and the spirit as well. When a headache comes, we all reach for the aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen or some combination of the three. Yet does covering this God-given symptom in the darkness bring healing or hiding? Perhaps we should all take a second look at this practice and start turning to God and asking the most important part: “why?” #soul #spirit #revelation 

When praying for a person that is afflicted with the plans of the enemy, pain can be a good source of revelation about why the affliction is taking place. The Holy Spirit will sometimes reveal pictures and words of knowledge about parts of the body, but what do these mean? There are many examples of ways to decipher these words of knowledge, but my favorite (proven over and over) is through the full armor of God. It looks like this: #soul #spirit #darkness #holy-spirit #invitation #revelation #prayer 


|Body Part     | Armor | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Head, neck |  Helmet of Salvation   | Belief (doubt) |
|Chest, back	|Breastplate of Righteousness |Sin, broken heart, betrayals
|Stomach, gut |Belt of Truth |Lies, deceit
|Legs, feet |Shoes of Peace |Division, condemnation, fear
|Dominate hand |Sword of Spirit |Attack on person’s calling
|Passive hand |Shield of Faith |Need baptism in the Holy Spirit

The “Meaning” column reflects examples of possible translations of the sin that was chosen by the person being delivered, and/or those that trespassed against them, and/or their forefathers. As with all things in Terraforming, do not use this column as a formula, but depend upon the Holy Spirit to reveal to you what the meaning is for each situation. God wants to see us set free! This is exactly what happens when we depend upon His Light to reveal the hidden sins in His timing, and then cast down the accuser with the Blood of the lamb and the word of our testimonies. #armor #holy-spirit #revelation #god #light #sin #blood #jesus 

### Fear and Anger

After dealing with defilement, we move on to heart wounds. The signatures of heart wounds are almost always fear and anger. These two frequently walk together. When a person’s heart is broken, they are in pain that is hard to describe. There is no medicine to take away the pain and suffering can take months, years, or even decades to heal. The most common sources of heart wounds are tied to all four defilements, but especially broken covenant. The short list of heart wound sources are as follows:

1. Trauma
2. Rejection
3. Abandonment
4. Betrayal
5. Neglect

As we’ve discussed before, satan tries to pin the ultimate blame of heart wounds on God to get us to accuse Him of one of these three sources. The result is that we are either afraid that God is not who He says He is, or we are angry at Him for what has happened to us. Once we’ve done this, we become the accuser and have allowed the kingdom of darkness to build the most powerful individual stronghold that can be made. If we have accused God, we must repent of this, receiving the Blood of the Lamb and speaking out the word of our testimony of freedom. Once we’ve hurled down the accuser, we must remember to remove all demons that have called rights to these sins, casting them to the feet of Jesus. This way the stronghold is shut down. #wound #heart #broken-covenant #accusation #kingdom #darkness #blood #jesus #demons #forgiveness #terraforming #splinter

### Residue

Demonic seeds ([[Matthew 13_24-29\|Matt 13:24-29]]) are excellent examples of trace materials left behind after demons are removed. These fingerprints of evil must be burned, blown, and washed away to #bible-verse

complete the cleansing of a person, place, or thing before entering the Presence of the Lord. By removing them, we also ensure that further intrusion by the kingdom of darkness will terminate. There are various techniques of extraction that depend upon the type of residue. Most can be removed through the all consuming fire of the Lord if we ask Him to come. #cleansed #kingdom-of-darkness 

The residue of heart wounds manifest as weapons of warfare. Rejection shows up on a person like arrows shot into their heart. As with most heart wounds, these can be generational, and the arrow creates a “shunt” in the heart that marks them as targets for continued rejection (victims). The shunt’s dual purpose is to act like a magnet for predators and to make shots into the heart easier for the next time they are rejected. Predators are humans that have committed repetitive sins of defilement. They become a host for a demonic spirit that adds power to their ability to lure. They are also uncontrollably attracted to victims with magnetic shunts in their hearts. #heart #wound #generation #rejection #rejected #sin #spirit #defilement 

The residue of abandonment and neglect shows up as a poisonous dart shot into the heart very similarly to the arrows of rejection. The shunt is not as open for further shots, but it does still act like a magnet for predators. Betrayal is reflected by a butchers knife in the back. With witchcraft involved, these blades can be twisted, crooked, or curved at the ends. It is extremely important that you take your time listening to the Holy Spirit about how the blade was altered so the specific sins can be forgiven and the blade straightened. Once this has happened, the blade will come out easily after the predator is forgiven and the accuser hurled down.  #abandoning #abandonment #heart #betrayal

One of the more powerful heart wounds is found in the victim of incest, especially where a parent is involved. I have seen few examples if any of parental incest where witchcraft was not involved either directly or through the generations, so it is safe to say that they are related. This combination is part of the strategy for altering the human DNA to the kingdom of the antichrist.

It is a modern example of [[Genesis 6_1-4\|Gen. 6:1-4]]. The signature of this violation is a fourth toe that is bent in the direction of the first, or “big toe.” In modern medical terms, the fourth digit or “p. nonvoratus” (piggy that had none) bent or curved at the middle phalanx in the direction of the first digit “p. fori” (piggy that went to market). I have literally prayed for hundreds of people with this signature where both incest and witchcraft were in the family. Once the predators were forgiven, the accuser hurled down, and the strongholds dismantled, the person’s life changed dramatically. #bible-verse #witchcraft #holy-spirit #rejection #generation #generational-sins #forgiveness #dismantle 

### Memory

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.”  [[Psalm 34_16\|Psalm 34:16]]* #bible-verse

The human mind remembers trespasses that were against us both directly and through the generations. Equally, the human body does as well. This is certainly true at the microscopic, DNA level where generational sins are passed down physically ([[Numbers 14_18\|Num. 14:18]]). This memory must be removed and / or neutralized before the demolition is complete. We pray healing for this affliction as a request of the Lord and a proclamation on the earth. The Father has already lead us to set the person free through forgiveness. #bible-verse  #generational-sins 

The highlighted signatures have been resolved. The final step is to clear all residue, and memory is the last major one of these. So unless you get a check in your spirit, declare the healing of all pain in mental memories, all habits, reflexes, and instincts of personality that have developed, and the restoration of the DNA of the person’s body as a part of the testimony of the forgiveness with the Blood of Jesus. At this point, the stronghold is fully dismantled.  #memory #generation #healing  #forgiveness

### Language

Profanity is an amazing paradox. Here you have simple words, combinations of letters with phonetic phrasing. Somehow these create a horrible sensation of pain for many listeners. But why? Why are we so offended by these simple, english alphabet sequences spoken by human information transmitters? Is it the meaning of the words? Are subject matters such as procreation and human waste forbidden topics in scripture? Clearly there is more to these words than just the particulars of language.  #language 

We see that language can be empowered with spiritual seeds that magnify the impact of their meaning. This goes beyond mere translation, these words are spiritually pregnant. A picture of this #spiritually-pregnant

can be found with fruit. When a mammal eats fruit from a tree, they ingest seeds with this fruit. When the mammal then defecates later, the seeds are passed and left on the ground with natural fertilizer. This was God’s process of multiplying fruit trees across the earth. As mammals travel distances between trees, the seeds are passed among an ever growing geographical area. #seed 

Over the years, some words have been impregnated with seeds of love and others with seeds of evil. When these are spoken by humans who have been created in the image of God with the power of life and death in their tongues, powerful events are set into motion. The atmosphere is seeded with either love or not love (good or evil). Adult sons and daughters of God are called to seed the atmosphere with life giving words, with testimonies of the goodness of God. These literally impart the gospel of Jesus Christ on earth. #seed #sons-and-daughters 

Royal Priests are called to clean up the atmosphere of the seeds of evil that fill the earth. We therefore forgive the people whose words have polluted the environment. By hurling down the accuser and stripping evil of its rights to use this against us, we capture significant ground for the Kingdom of God. Over time, these words can be redeemed to their original purpose. In the meantime, we can take away from the kingdom of darkness the power that makes these words painful to listen to, and harmful when the seeds germinate, take root, and produce fruit of evil.  #love #evil #god #testimony #root #fruit

### Dismantling a Hardened Heart

The first step in our prayers for a person with a hardened heart is to remove the work of the enemy in their lives. The Lord will usually choose someone with the greatest authority in their lives to lead the prayer such as a spouse, child, or other that they are in covenant with. The chosen person along with others will call in the Light of Jesus to reveal the hidden sins that the enemy is using as legal rights to maintain the strongholds of deception. The chosen person will then forgive them of these sins, hurling down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. They will dismantle the power of the sins and thank the Lord for remembering their sins no more. #prayer #heart #authority #sin #legal-right #dismantle #forgiveness 

They will ask the Lord to heal them of all wounds and the pain associated with them. They will ask Him to heal the person of all habits, reflexes, and instincts that have been learned over the years of deception. They will proclaim the strongholds destroyed and cast all demons who have lost their rights to the feet of Jesus. We outlaw deception in the life of this person. This process can be repeated for the person’s home, work, church, and all material objects in their lives.  #demon #legal-right #healing #wound 

Finally, we ask the Lord to intervene in their lives. We ask Him to enter the “crack in the door” we have made through love and forgiveness and to invade the person’s dreams, shower time, and work with revelation. We ask Him to make all sin bitter in their lives and all righteousness sweet. We pray for mercy and grace while this person is healing. We ask Him to bring people into their life that reinforce Christ and reject sin. We ask the Lord for victory!#adult-season  #forgiveness #revelation #love #grace #healing #testimony

## Chapter 19: Restoring Land

>*“Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of truth; he who takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes.” [[Isaiah 65_16\|Isaiah 65:16]]* #bible-verse 

Creation is so much bigger than just us humans. The Lord created the heavens and the earth. He created light, time, atmosphere, gathered water (sea), dry ground (land), vegetation (plants and trees), the sun, the moon, the stars, and living creatures (in the waters, in the sky, and on the land). All of these things He called very good. Man was commissioned to subdue the earth and to rule over the living creatures.

> [!quote]+ 
>*“In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.” [[Genesis 2_9c\|Genesis 2:9c]]*  #bible-verse 

The Lord placed two trees in the center of the garden. These represented the choice of destinies for creation. One represented the destiny of dependency on God for everything. The other introduced the tainting that lucifer had brought to creation through the choice of self glorification and independence. So then, when the sin of disobedience was committed, Adam and Eve would know the pain of self reliance: toiling the ground for work and painful childbirth.

The root of all sin is self directed. The evil one, lucifer, wanted the glory of God to be self directed. Once Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the human race was married to its ruler: satan. We have taken on his characteristics for too long: liars, thieves, accusers, and destroyers. Why would we do these things? To protect and glorify ME. The self is the focus of all sin. It is 100% contrary to the definition of Love, which is unconditionally focused towards our Lover, not our self. #self-sourcing #selfish #satan

When sin entered the land outside of Eden at the hands of Cain, defilement was introduced. This is multiplied many times over as billions of people have populated the earth since creation (by some estimates over 100 billions births). Figuring that each human may sin many, many times in their life, the number of potential land defiling sins committed is staggering. The job of cleaning this up seems monumental, but all things are possible with God. Now our job is to clean and then speak forth blessings in the land, calling out the fullness of the destiny of all of creation! #root #sin #evil-one #creation #fullness #love #relationship 

### Defilement

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Men will be regularly employed to cleanse the land. Some will go throughout the land and, in addition to them, others will bury those that remain on the ground. At the end of the seven months they will begin their search. As they go through the land and one of them sees a human bone, he will set up a marker beside it until the gravediggers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Gog. And so they will cleanse the land.” [[Ezekiel 39_14-16\|Ezekiel 39:14-16]]* #bible-verse

Land does not sin. People do. As such, when land is defiled, we do not respond by washing the land with the Blood of Jesus. We love and fully forgive those who sinned by washing their feet with the Blood of Jesus and speaking out the word of their testimony of what the Blood has done for them. They are purified of all unrighteousness. They are redeemed of every consequence. They are restored to a right relationship with God. The accuser is hurled down and the memory of these sins is erased from all matter on earth (people, places, things). Then the land is cleansed.  #sin #blood #jesus #testimony #restored #purified #relationship #accuser

>*“The LORD said, ‘What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground. Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.’” [[Genesis 4_10-12\|Genesis 4:10-12]]* #bible-verse

Blood shed is the first defilement of land. This can relate to the murder of innocent men or women of God ([[Lamentations 4_14\|Lam. 4:14]]) or even the corpses of the enemies of the Lord (Ezekiel 39). This can included aborted babies, torture of the innocents, practices of cutting, and other witchcraft rituals that involve the shedding of blood (sacrifices). All of these people must be fully forgiven for the land to be free of its memory of this blood. #bible-verse #defilement #bloodshed #memory 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant.” [[Isaiah 24_5\|Isaiah 24:5]]* #bible-verse

Broken covenant is the second defilement of land. These covenants can be with the Lord or with other persons. Saul broke covenant with the Gibeonites and stained his house with blood when he swore to spare them and then later tried to annihilate them ([[2 Samuel 21_1-2\|2 Sam. 21:1-2]]) resulting in a famine that lasted three years. Also, swindling (stealing from those that trust you), going against your word, and false pretense (lying to build trust) are examples. #bible-verse #broken-covenant

>*“I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.” [[Jeremiah 16_18\|Jeremiah 16:18]]* #bible-verse

Idolatry is the third defilement of the land. Since the resurrection of Jesus, when people who have chosen Him as their savior and bow to the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and King David then bow to another god, they are polluting that which is Holy. All witchcraft and occult based activities are idolatry with demons. All pagan religions are idolatry with demons in disguise. All esoteric societies that introduce ancient rituals and rites from non-Hebrew lands are idolatrous. #sacrifices #witchcraft #trust #defilement #jesus #demons #idolatry

>*“But you must keep My decrees and My laws. The native-born and the aliens living among you must not do any of these detestable things *[sexual immorality]*, for all these things were done by the people who lived in the land before you, and the land became defiled. And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you.”* [[Leviticus 18_26-28\|Lev. 18:26-28]]* #bible-verse 

Sexual immorality is the fourth and last defilement. In Leviticus 18, many sins are listed including sex with close relatives, women during menstruation, same-gender relations, and bestiality. Adultery is a combination of sexual immorality (fornication) and broken covenant (betrothal covenant). We are to love and forgive our brethren when they commit these sins as the Father has loved and forgiven us. Do not judge any person, but always walk in the knowledge of our own susceptibility to sin ourselves. #bethrothal-covenant  #broken-covenant #forgiveness 

Underneath all defilements is the work of the enemy to get humans to enter into evil covenants. Lucifer wants the bride to enter into an evil betrothal covenant not for Love, but to use and discard her when her value is gone. When a person willfully enters into this covenant, or is entered in as a result of the generational sin of their forefathers, they can be recognized by the characteristics they have in common with their groom: liars ([[John 8_44\|John 8:44]]), accusers ([[Revelation 12_10-12\|Rev. 12:10 - 12]]), thieves and destroyers ([[John 10_10\|John 10:10]]). Not everyone who lies or steals is in marital covenant with satan, but those who are will be powerfully bound to the sins. Dissolve these covenants and dismantle the sins and defilements as a Royal Priest and set all of creation free! This is where the fun begins. #bible-verse #bethrothal-covenant  #love #forgive #covenants #satan #church #bride #not-love #choice #love #generational-sins #marriage #royal-priest #creation #freedom #dismantle 

### Bundling

>*“I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people. One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their king will pass through before them, the LORD at their head.”  [[Micah 2_12-13\|Micah 2:12-13]]* #bible-verse

With billions of people that have lived on the earth since creation, it is reasonable to guess that there may be trillions of sins that have occurred and defiled the land. The Lord knows this and also the number of His children on earth that will be called to cleanse the land. As such, He has blessed us with the ability to bundle when necessary. First we ask Him to shine the Light of His Presence to reveal the hidden sins (what) and the specific sinner (who). In many cases, He will reveal to us that information with great clarity.

In other cases He may be silent. We may not have to declare the specific sin or the specific sinner. Instead the Lord has us say, “*I forgive every person *(who) *for every time they fell short of the glory of God *(what). *I sprinkle them with the Blood of Jesus and they are purified and redeemed*.” In this way the person, place, or thing is blanketed in forgiveness and the accuser is hurled down.

### Riches

> [!quote]+ 
>*“I will give you the treasures of darkness, riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the LORD, the God of Israel, who summons you by name.” [[Isaiah 45_3\|Isaiah 45:3]]*  #bible-verse

In Colorado, Larry and I found blessings that the Lord had stored in the land. To be honest, we had been looking for gold coins. Every prophetic word pointed to gold being found in the land, which was confirmed with scriptures emphasizing riches and storehouses ([[Job 38_22\|Job 38:22]]) which are buried under snow and hail. We did not find gold coins in the natural. What we found was of far greater value. We found spiritual keys that unlock the fullness of our calling. We found that which would bring us to perfection and thus the fullness of authority that God wanted to impart.  #bible-verse #storehouse #spiritual-key #fullness #authority 

*“Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. So he said to them, ‘Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people. If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man*

>*sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?’ His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death.” [[1 Samuel 2_22-25\|1 Samuel 2:22-25]]*  #bible-verse

The Lord has been speaking to us about the sons of Eli for sometime now. He has shown us the importance of Eli’s priesthood and Saul’s royal house in comparison to the royal house of David and the priesthood of Zadok. Saul did not have an intimate relationship with God. Because of this, he had to turn to Samuel for direction. David did have a direct relationship with the Lord and was a man after His own heart. Equally, Zadok was loyal to the Lord’s will as manifested in his loyalty to the royal house of David (Solomon’s election for the throne). Eli was disloyal to the Lord as demonstrated in his failure to move the behavior of his sons through discipline. He rebuked them, but failed in discipline. #priest 

It was in Colorado that we found a rich spiritual river of the anointing and impartation of returning justice and discipline to the Body of Christ, especially in the United States. Before we left He had downloaded the revelation about the soul being splintered, the need for the valves to be fully opened, and the danger of the soul leading the being of a person when it is the spirit that receives from the Lord where it is seated in Heavenly places. We knew that there were issues of behavior that needed to be dealt with, but the pieces had not come together fully yet. #soul #splinter #spirit 

As soon as we got to Colorado, the picture came to form. We got the 4 7 revelation (perfection / completeness of the gates), we saw the hail that pictured the storehouses the Lord had buried there. He tied all the loose ends on our third day there in a vision as I woke up. He showed me how justice and discipline are meant to avoid judgement. They are tools that the Lord has given us to take us the rest of the way beyond defeating the evil one. They help us defeat ourselves: our own freewill that can make or break us in reaching the fullness of our destiny. #intimacy #relationship #church #spirit #evil-one #freewill #fullness #storehouse #gate

>*Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: ‘I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before Me forever.’ But now the LORD declares: ‘Far be it from Me! Those who honor Me I will honor, but those who despise Me will be disdained. I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in My heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before My anointed one always.’” [[1 Samuel 2_27,29b-30,35\|1 Samuel 2:27,29b-30,35]]*  #bible-verse

The headlines of the Denver Post that day read, “Out of Hiding, Seeking Justice.” My full name is Scott Justice Norvell (named after my mother’s grandfather, Scott Justice). The name Scott has the spiritual connotation of “Temple.” My name literally means, Temple Justice, or the justice and discipline that Eli never brought to his sons, costing them the priesthood. The priesthood was passed to Zadok and his sons. On April 1, 2008 the Lord called me a Priest in the order of Zadok and confirmed in June 2008 that I would train the sons of Zadok for the end times. All of this was brought into focus in June 2009 as the vision of the Lord came to me in Colorado. #priest

>*“For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.” [[Hebrews 12_7b,8,11\|Hebrews 12:7b,8,11]]*  #bible-verse

Terraforming was given by God to the Body of Christ to be a handbook for the royal priests in the end times. It is important beyond measure that we understand how the priesthood was taken from the house of Eli and why. We must know that the willful choices of his sons to fall short of the Glory of God were contemptuous and could not be overlooked ([[1 Samuel 2_17\|1 Sam. 2:17]]). We must understand that even with the complete dismantling of the kingdom of darkness, we are back to square one as Adam was: we still have to choose Love over not-Love. The Lord will not make our choice for us. We must choose what is right. If our behavior conflicts with this, we are accountable to address this with God for his grace and mercy, and to submit to the provision of justice and discipline so this behavior will change.  #bible-verse #terraforming #church #royal-priest  #dismantle #kingdom-of-darkness  #love #not-love #choice #grace #provision

### Blessings

> [!quote]+ 
>*“He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.”* [[Proverbs 28_19\|Proverbs 28:19]]* #bible-verse 

The destiny of the Roman empire was to mature into adulthood, receive the fullness of the authority the Lord wanted to delegate, and then bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world. Instead, the gospel of Jesus Christ became a religion (christianity), was combined with pagan practices, and the church was rendered impotent. After this the Lord gave Rome many chances for redemption, even after its decline. In the 800’s AD Charlemagne (my 41st-great grandfather) placed Jesus Christ at the head of the Holy Roman Empire, but failed at imparting His Love. Instead, conversions were forced upon people and nations, bringing resentment and loss where there should have been freedom and gain. #destiny #mature #fullness #authority 

The enemy wants to pollute the blessings in the land so they cannot be used by the royal priests to bring the Bride into her fullness. Additionally, satan wants to use the blessings for perverted purposes that strengthens the power of the kingdom of darkness to continue its practices and prevent judgement from ever happening. To this end, all deception, temptation, accusation, theft and destruction that occurs in dark places is meant for this purpose: keeping creation from its destiny. Like Rome, the destiny of the United States is to mature into adulthood, receive the authority, and bring the gospel to the world. Evil is working hard to keep this from happening. #royal-priest #fullness #destiny 

All land has destiny sown into it by its creator, our Father in Heaven. In the town I live in, Tulsa, Oklahoma, one example of that blessing is the anointing for worship. The Lord wants to raise up powerful worship in His people as a fruit of being God- reliant. The enemy wants to pervert this through the sin of idolatry, specifically through the worship of mankind.

The two biggest selling country artists of all time are from the Tulsa area and have been massively successful outside of the genre. Neither sing for evil purposes. Yet the perversion of the evil one has caused audiences to respond to this blessing with sin (idolatry of man). Being a “star” is the ambitions of many people of this generation. At the root of stardom is self-glory, which is sin. #worship #covenant #condition #idolatry #sin #root 

In Colorado, the blessing was justice and discipline to get the Body of Christ ready for her Groom. Yet the evil one has polluted discipline by influencing a society based upon self gain. Only those infractions that cause chaos are punished, not those that are contrary to Love. Therefore it is unlawful to murder (root of chaos) yet lawful and encouraged to be greedy as long as you follow the generally accepted practices of wealth accumulation. The discipline of adults is also viewed very negatively by modern society, which is far too prideful (self importance) to be humbled voluntarily. The enemy has also influenced psycho-perversion and sexual immorality (self- pleasure) as distractions from God’s original design for discipline. #heart #god #fruit #good-and-evil #evil-one #root #sin #church #love #groom #self-sourcing #temptation 

In Virginia, the blessing sown by God was fruitfulness. This multiplying effect would have the benefit of distributing the gospel of Jesus Christ through the early settlers quickly and efficiently. What grew was tobacco, which was then cured and smoked in peace ceremonies by the Native American tribes. The evil one then came with the temptation of lust (self pleasure), murder (self positioning), and broken covenant (self advancement at the expense of others). Now the fruit of tobacco is lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death among men in the western hemisphere. #self-sourcing #self-seeking 

The opportunity in front of us for the Body of Christ is to dismantle evil in the lives of all people, all places, and all things in creation. We can then enter the storehouses of provision, the riches that God has hidden in the land for such a time as this. When individual groups of people walk in this destiny, they will affect their region. When other groups in the surrounding area do the same, their region is affected until the inflating boundaries of impact bump into each other and entire nations are restored. And from nations, the world. #jesus #broken-covenant #evil-one #temptation #fruit #church #storehouse #provision #dismantle #discernment

### Honor

There once was a man in prison. He was guilty of his crime and readily admitted this. For him, days were spent in regret as he remembered his childhood, dreaming of being an astronaut when he grew up. Instead he was locked in a cell where the memories of childhood seemed distant, his hopes seemed shattered. One day, the jailer came and unlocked his cell. He was led to a room in the prison where he was told that the leader of their nation had granted him a full pardon. #memory #allegory 

He was free! This concept alone was beyond his reckoning. As they allowed him to change clothes and then led him to the exit, his mind raced with possibilities. He simply could not believe that his life of captivity, alone in a cell with no rights, no freedom, and withered dreams was over. When they opened the last doors to the prison and the bright light shone on his face, he was surprised to see that a limousine was waiting to take him the rest of the way.  #seed #allegory #light #allegory 

Inside the limo was the leader of their nation himself! He had come to give the freedman a very specific message. “*We have identified you with a unique skill set. Because of this, you are being sent to astronaut training at an undisclosed location*.” The man could not believe his ears. He had been set free from prison. His offenses had been pardoned. His rights had been fully restored to him and life could begin again. This alone was enough for him to be grateful for the rest of his life. Now they want to make his dreams a reality by making him an astronaut? #grace #freedom #fullness #allegory 

The man tried to explain all of these emotions to the leader. He almost changed the subject, as the prospect of his life changing from negative 80 to positive 20 and now to positive 100 in just a few minutes, was beyond his comprehension. The leader interrupted him, “*I wasn’t finished. We are also honoring you. You will be the first human being to land and set foot on the planet Mars*.” The man was speechless. How is it possible for a person to go from captivity to freedom, to then having your longings fulfilled? And then from longing fulfilled to being honored in such a way? Was he dreaming? #allegory

As with all things in the Lord, freedom from captivity is only the beginning of the story. Next comes testing (training) and then the promised land (blessed and honored). The Israelites saw this same process as they were freed from Egypt. This is true of all creation. God has designed us with purpose that is beyond our wildest dreams. The evil one has corrupted creation with lies told in the dark. When people, the rulers of creation, come into agreement with these lies, creation is held in captivity. If instead, we walk in the Light, we can set creation free with the Blood. If we will then submit to His Authority, He will work all of the kinks out. Then we can fulfill our purpose of leading creation to its destiny! #freedom #forgiveness  #purpose  #destiny #invitation  #allegory

As sons and daughters of God, we have been given an inheritance from our Lord. Our Father planned who we would be, what we would be called to do, and what people, places, and things we would interact with throughout our lives. He did not plan our choices, these He fore-knew. Yet when we say “yes” to the call of God, the Lord releases this inheritance to us. We begin to walk in the amazing life that He intended for us! And what is this inheritance? It is Him. In His Presence all things fall into place. #sons-and-daughters #inheritance #father

The Light of Jesus has revealed all impurities that must be dealt with. Through forgiveness, these impurities are washed away with the Blood of Jesus and the word of our testimony. All enemy agents have been detached and removed from their strongholds. The angels of God are now in place. This person, this place, this thing are now clean. Who may stand in the Presence of God? Only he who is clean and pure can. We are now ready for the Presence of the Lord. We are ready for the King of Glory to come in.

>*“When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart.” [[Matthew 13_19a\|Matthew 13:19a]]* #bible-verse

In the Parable of the Sower we learn that seeds of the kingdom are sown in our hearts. These seeds are foundational pieces of the destiny we are called to in Christ, intended to produce fruit for the Kingdom that has eternal ramifications. These can be stolen from us by the enemy through our belief in his lies, through our faltering when persecuted, or through our worldly (non-kingdom) intentions for God’s promises.

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Yet if [a thief] is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house.” [[Proverbs 6_31\|Proverbs 6:31]]* #bible-verse

When the Light of Jesus reveals the Truth to us and we reconcile to God through the precious Blood, we see these seeds fully restored to us by demanding that the thief return what he stole. We can then ask the Holy Spirit to re-sow these back into our hearts where they belong. If they are kingdom promises, we need them and should fight for them. When the seeds are sown in good soil, we will produce fruit in some cases a hundredfold what was planted. #truth #seed #holy-spirit

Many people who have been deceived by the lies of the evil one look back after many years with deep sorrow feeling that their life was stolen from them. They believe that the hopes and dreams from their youth are gone for good and cannot be returned to them. Many feel like Job did right around chapter 3 – they have lost property, children, a spouse, their health, or their calling in God. They believe that their life has been lost forever. But through the restoration power of the Blood of Jesus, this is not so! Our lives are a net gain! Whenever the Truth is believed in place of the lie, the Blood is the power that takes us to Job chapter 42: full restoration of what was stolen—with restitution!  #revelation #restoration  #holy-spirit #heart #evil-one #fullness

### Calling

>*“I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.” [[Philippians 3_12b\|Philippians 3:12b]]* #bible-verse 

Early in 2005, the Lord moved Shari and me to Tulsa, Oklahoma from our mountain fortress (cabin) in Colorado. It was here that the Lord connected me with the blessings of the land in Tulsa, combined with my personal calling in the Lord and with all of the seeds of life that He had sown in my heart through my spiritual mentors on earth. From this change in our circumstances came some early fruit of the gifts God had given me. But none would compare with what happened when we abandoned all to follow Him.

Late in 2006 I learned that my childhood best friend had died of a drug overdose. This news impacted my being with great force and I wept loudly in Shari’s arms for hours. Standing on my relationship with God, I kept crying out to Him for intervention for my friend. Fearing for the eternal implications of his death, I called out, “Lord! He was my brother!” The Lord answered back instantaneously through Shari, “They are ALL your brothers.” This rocked me to the core. I realized that the Lord was revealing to me His heart when people die not receiving the free gift of salvation through believing in Jesus. After this, nothing would be the same. #revelation

By January of 2007 the Lord had shown me that He had a great call on our lives and to fulfill this, there was further change needed in our lives. I needed to quit my job. Now this may sound simple, but for me it was nowhere near that. We have five children and Shari stays at home, so how would we live? The Lord said, “Trust Me.” I had heard this before, and as always, He was right. Over time, I came to realize that it was God calling me to quit. And if He called me to it, I knew it was the right thing to do. #calling #seed #heart #fruit #gifts #revelation #heart-of-God #salvation #jesus #trust 

### Yes, However...

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.” [[Hebrews 4_16\|Hebrews 4:16]]* #bible-verse

That being said, I knew that I was unable to quit my job. It was quite a dilemma. On one hand I knew that the Lord was calling me to quit. I had to say “yes.” On the other, I knew that I was not capable of walking out that “yes,” despite the fact that it was what I wanted more than anything. These are the times in life when we must be honest with God. Tell Him the truth! I know this may come as a surprise to some, but the Lord actually wants to hear us admit when we need help. God is not judging us on how we earn His love, He is watching to see if we CHOOSE Him or not. In this case, I was able to choose Him by simply acknowledging my inability to accept His invitation to quit. #journey #faith #trust 

I needed a savior. Praise God! When I admitted it, He responding with, “I’ve been waiting to hear you say that!” God is in the business of saving people. This was no surprise to Him. Over the course of the next few months, the Lord lovingly confirmed His word to me over and over again. As time went by, my heart changed. I realized that no matter what He called us to do, no matter how costly, it would be worth it. He would meet our every need!   #faith #trust #journey #His-will #provision #adventure #testimony

On May 11, 2007 I quit my job as a Senior Vice President in banking and started our life in faith. Since that time the Lord has been faithful to meet our every need. It has not always looked the way I wanted it to, but it was according to His plan, and it was for our good. Everything exploded in our lives after that day. We have come to understand our gifts and calling in a far greater way than ever before. There are truly no words to express how our lives have changed. Since we gave God the reins in our lives, we are living the great adventure. #provision #trust #gift #adventure

>*“No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him” [[1 Corinthians 2_9\|1 Corinthians 2:9]]* #bible-verse 

I understand now that God created me with a plan in mind. He chose to assign to me a certain number of talents that would fit the life that He had designed for me. He hand picked the gifts of the Spirit that I would need to accomplish my mission. He aligned me with the people and placed me on the land that would support this mission with blessing and anointing to bring the revelation of this book to the world. That was my destiny. It has been available to me my whole life. I only had to accept the invitation and walk in it. #mission #spirit #gift #destiny #invitation #trust #journey #alignment 

What has the Lord planned for you? Does He have great responsibilities for you to walk out or lesser ones? Will you minister to those who are sick? Will you evangelize the lost? Will you lead a nation to the higher calling? Will you tell the Truth even if it gets you killed? For this call, you will need to lay everything on the altar. There is nothing that can be held back. It costs you everything. #invitation #heart-of-God #calling 

But it is worth it.

### Consecration

> [!quote]+ 
>*“So you shall put them on Aaron your brother and on his sons with him. You shall anoint them, consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to Me as priests.” [[Exodus 28_41\|Exodus 28:41]]* #bible-verse

Before welcoming the Presence of the Lord into the hearts of His people, we anoint them with oil. This is a statement of their being consecrated unto the Lord by the Blood of Jesus. Any oil can be used, although olive oil is our preferred choice. There is also oil you can buy for such purposes that has been prayed over and mixed with aromatic resins. A mere dab can be placed on the person’s hands and/or forehead or just about any other appropriate place with the person’s permission. Samuel did pour the oil over Saul and David’s heads, but that dramatic of a statement is usually not required for this purpose. #consecration #anointing 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“And the children of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, brought the tithe of oxen and sheep; also the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God they laid in heaps.” [[2 Chronicles 31_6\|2 Chronicles 31:6]]* #bible-verse

Places and things should also be anointed with oil. Many techniques have been developed by intercessors throughout the years for claiming a territory that are excellent and useful. These include anointing doors, windows, furniture, and even the boundary corners of a property (including larger territories such as cities or States). Cars, roads, bridges, and highway marker posts are all possible targets. Some have buried scripture verses written on paper, stakes, and rocks in the earth of a property. The list is endless, and all can be appropriate, as led by the Holy Spirit. #anointing #blood #jesus #consecration #intercessors #holy-spirit #authority

### Worship

*“Heavenly Father, we praise Your Name. We come to You today with a heart of thanksgiving for this Kingdom Family that You have invited us into. It is such a privilege to be called your sons and daughters. There is nothing greater than the life You have given us both in our identity and the destiny You created us for. Your Light changes our condition radically from pain, sorrow, and grief to celebration.*

*Thank You for Jesus. Thank You for the King that loves us so much, He died that we might inherit life and to have it more abundantly. We are grateful for the gift of praising Your name in eternal glory for saving us through the atoning Blood of Jesus.*

*Thank You for the gift of Your Holy Spirit. We thank You Lord for the authority and the power to be set free and the commission to set others free. We thank You for the mandate to bring Your Will on earth as it is in heaven. We receive all that You are in our lives. We yield to Your endless Love, Wisdom, Mercy, and Grace. Yours is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory forever.”*

Amen. #prayer

## Epilogue: The Diabolical Plans of diablo

>*“Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning...” [[2 Corinthians 11_3a\|2 Corinthians 11:3a]]*  #bible-verse 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“...in order that satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.”* *[[2 Corinthians 2_11\|2 Corinthians 2:11]]*  #bible-verse 

Years ago we lived in Garland, Texas in a small, brick house. In that neighborhood, all garages were in the backyard, so you would have an alley that ran between all houses that shared the same backyard property lines. The alley was white concrete and would access all of the driveways that each house had. One day we were returning from an outing at night, we turned into our alley to get to our garage. I noticed that this night, the white, concrete alley was black.

When I stopped the car to get a better look, we slid for a few feet almost as if we were on ice. This was summertime, so I knew that would not be the case. When we came to a stop and my eyes were able to focus on the ground, I realized that the pavement was moving. After a closer look I saw that the entire alley was covered with millions of one to two inch long black cockroaches! We screamed loudly and drove on to our garage, sliding on squished bugs all the way!

This tragically real event has always served as a picture for me of current events in the world. When our sights are set on the larger things in front us of, such as people, trees, or cars, we can

miss the things that threaten us below our field of vision (thumbtacks, tree roots, or potholes). While we focus on church, work, school, housecleaning, and football games, an ancient plan of evil is being developed and unleashed under our very feet. It is the dark places, hidden from view, where the evil one is busy at work, implementing his plans for defeating the Lord.

It looks like a game of chess. Both players have a strategy, which is hidden from the other player, but is revealed over time as game pieces are moved. The board begins to take the shape of the two strategies as they are played out. The evil one “captures” the Lord’s pieces away from the Truth, while enemy pieces are captured by Christ for eternity. And with all things, the Lord has the advantage. He is revealing aspects of the enemy’s plan so we can help win the game. #evil-one #god #truth #revelation #choice 

### The Rules

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life.” [[Leviticus 17_11\|Leviticus 17:11]]*  #bible-verse

For Love to be fully realized in creation, rules had to be put in place. These should not be confused with the Law given to Moses on Mount Sinai. These rules are older. Much older. They are parameters that preserve the conditions required for Love to exist. The Rules include, but are not limited to: #love #boundaries 

1. The power of “creation and destruction on earth” comes from the choices of man, especially those spoken with the tongue, which must be made as an act of their freewill ([[Proverbs 18_21\|Proverbs 18:21]]).  #bible-verse
2. The blessings of covenant come from God and are given as a result of righteous choices made by the person or the person’s forefathers (1000 generations - [[Deuteronomy 5_10\|Deuteronomy 5:10]]).  #bible-verse
3. Torment and affliction come from satan and result from evil choices made by the person or the person’s forefathers (4 generations, revolving - [[Numbers 14_18\|Numbers 14:18]]). Demons refer to this as a “legal right.”  #bible-verse
4. Life is in the blood of all creatures, including man ([[Leviticus 17_11\|Leviticus 17:11]]).   #bible-verse

---
<p style="text-align:center;">

</p> 
{ #p174}


---

5. The choice of allegiance is demonstrated through the shedding of innocent blood. Examples: the atonement of sins and the sacrifices made to pagan gods. When humans consume blood, the Lord sets His face against them, and they belong to not- love. See [[Leviticus 17_10-12\|Leviticus 17:10-12]]. #bible-verse
6. There was a very real opportunity for either Love or not-love to prevail (see below).
7. In case of a dispute, God has the final say ([[Psalm 105_7\|Psalm 105:7]]) #bible-verse

 PLAYING TO WIN

> [!quote]+ 
>*“You said, 'I will continue forever—the eternal queen!' “ [[Isaiah 47_7a\|Isaiah 47:7a]]* #bible-verse

There has been a common belief that the enemy has admitted defeat, expects eternal torment, and is working for the sole purpose of taking as many of God’s children down the tube with him as he can. While there is some truth in this, it is more accurate to say that the evil one is still playing to win. He is trying to beat God at His own rules and keep his kingdom for his own and as far away from Jesus as possible. Is he deceived or does he know something that we don’t?

> [!quote]+ 
>*“Perhaps you will succeed, perhaps you will cause terror.” [[Isaiah 47_12b\|Isaiah 47:12b]]*  #bible-verse

God is not sarcastic. Creation has been designed under the premise that either Love or not-love can prevail. Just as humans had to be given free will and choice, so too did creation require the feasibility of either choice to be realized. In more simple terms, not-love has the opportunity to prevail. Now don’t get me wrong, I have read the end of the book just like you have and know that Love wins the war. But we have gone on believing that our job is to only win souls and not to defeat the enemy way too long. In truth, our job is both. #not-love #love #freewill #choice #souls 

Satan has an end game as well. He wants to use our words and our blood against us. His is attempting to get us to unknowingly renounce the Lord. He lies to us continuously, perverting all that God created and all that is good. Some of these alterations are dramatic and are easy to spot.

Others are more subtle and require revelation from the Holy Spirit. If he is successful in getting us to renounce the Lord, we are in reality proclaiming him to be king. When Jesus said, “It is finished” it did not mean “It is over.” Otherwise He would have taken the Jews and started the millennial kingdom 2,000 years ago. He did not because there is a job to do. We were created for a time such as this to bring the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Will of our Father on earth as it is in Heaven. We must defeat this enemy once and for all. We will do this by forgiving the human beings whose sins are empowering the kingdom of darkness with the Blood of Jesus and the word of our testimonies. #deception #blood #choice #revelation #holy-spirit #satan 

> [!quote]+ 
>*“...on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.” [[Matthew 16_18b\|Matthew 16:18b]]* #bible-verse

Jesus prophesied the end correctly. We will overcome evil as we walk in our true identities and destinies as sons and daughters of the King. If we were not to, evil (not-love) wins. This word is like ripping the pacifier and security blanket away from a baby. We are feeling cold and angry at the revelation that we must fight this war. It wakes us up. This is exactly what the world needs right now to realize our birthright. #jesus #His-will #father #forgiveness #identity #sons-and-daughters #god #birthright 

### Time

> [!quote]+ 
>*“For a thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.” [[Psalm 90_4\|Psalm 90:4]]* #bible-verse 

Time is a concept that we live in, but is within God, that is, He is outside of time. Ultimately, this means that God knows the end, knows how we will choose, and has the ability to focus His Blessings on those areas that have the maximum impact for His desired results. The devil is at an immeasurable disadvantage, while God has the ultimate upper hand. Evil is not yet fully defeated and still has the ability to win this, but will not. 

> [!quote]+

The confidence of the Lord is in us. He knows that with His Grace, Mercy, and the power of Christ within us, we will rise up and become all that we were created to be. He knows that the gates of hades will not overcome us. God believes in us because He created us. He knows that we will complete this picture. It is time for us to respond to His calling with the word “yes” and to get the job done. The evil one has been working around the clock while we’ve been sleeping. There is plenty to do, and to undo. #confidence #grace #jesus #gate

### Pagan Religion

> [!quote]+ 
>*“...the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons.”* *[[1 Corinthians 10_20\|1 Corinthians 10:20]]* #bible-verse 

To understand the plot of the enemy, we can look in the bible. There are many descriptions of what the evil one has done, and what he will do in the future, found in the words of the Old Testament prophets. Another prime place to look is at pagan religions. Why you ask? Because they are a hiding place for many demons disguised as gods. We can solve for their role in these religions with this simple equation deriving from [[1 Corinthians 10_20\|1 Corinthians 10:20]]:

sacrifices + pagan gods	=	sacrifices + demons
-sacrifices	-sacrifices pagan gods = demons

Satan’s first step was to fabricate his own religions. He did this with the help of humans and their wonderfully creative abilities. We know that many demons under satan’s authority appeared before humans in a form they recognized. He got the rights to do this from the sins of those humans. Once the sinners were listening to demons, they influenced the creation of false or pagan religions. #evil-one #demons #satan #religions #sin

### Heroes of Old, Men of Renown

> [!quote]+ 
>*When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God *[angels] *saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. The Nephilim were on the earth in those days— and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.” [[Genesis 6_1-2,4\|Genesis 6:1-2,4]]*  #bible-verse 

It is a tough pill to swallow, but the first of many. Angels can appear as humans ([[Hebrews 13_2\|Heb. 13:2]]). Fallen angels can as well. This could have been through the physical manifestation of demons in a human-like form, or the “possessed” state (for a lack of a better term) of a human with a demon inside of him. Either case, the rights of this kind of manifestation came from the rituals and practices of pagan religions. We know that this includes human and animal sacrifices, sexual immorality, spells, incantations, potions, curses, and oaths / vows / covenants of evil. #bible-verse #angel #demon #religion #broken-covenant #defilement #witchcraft 

Once these had been performed, the demons have obtained allegiance from those humans and are empowered from the gifts and calling of God, which are irrevocable ([[Romans 11_29\|Rom. 11:29]]). The ability to create, choose, and judge as God does was used against them for demonic purposes, elevating the pagan religions with power. The enemy then used this to get willing and involuntary sex partners to create children that were perversions of God’s original design. #bible-verse #demon #religion 

The women were targeted so that the offspring would be born into power (men of renown) and with military authority (heroes of old). In other words, government. This way they can bring the pagan religion to the masses en force, whether the recipients are voluntary or not. Entire cultures of civilization were overrun this way. It got so bad that the Lord had to destroy every living creature on the planet, except Noah, his family, and the animals that God brought into the ark.  #covenants #gifts #calling #god #authority

### Solomon

> [!quote]+ 
>*“King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh's daughter—Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites. They were from nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, ‘You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.’ Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love. He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been. He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites. So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not follow the LORD completely, as David his father had done.” [[1 Kings 11_1-6\|1 Kings 11:1-6]]* #bible-verse

Solomon was a mighty man of God. He wrote the book of Proverbs (in addition to Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and two Psalms), which many regard as a central repository for daily wisdom in the bible. This is not surprising given Solomon’s request of wisdom ([[1 Kings 3_9\|1 Kings 3:9]]), and the Lord’s reaction of being pleased with the choice he made. Unquestionably, Solomon is one of the good guys. His descendants include our Lord Jesus. #bible-verse

Yet Solomon’s legacy was greatly tainted. His lust for women was his undoing. This generational sin against [[Deuteronomy 17_17\|Deut. 17:17]] came from David, but it was Solomon whose heart was led astray to other gods, causing him to break his covenant with the Lord ([[1 Kings 9_6-7\|1 Kings 9:6-7]]). When this happened, Solomon released evil to the people of God for many generations. There are only a handful of examples of Solomon’s descendants who as rulers of the divided kingdom did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord. #bible-verse #wisdom #lust #generational-sins #heart  

The results of this are shocking. The breaking of the covenant of the Lord by his chosen people and their rulers opened up much in the spirit realm for the kingdom of darkness. God’s people were sent into Babylonian captivity, where they were stripped of all that they had been given by God as a blessing, and all that

they held to be holy. Meanwhile the rest of the world was dominated by pagan religions and the evil that they bring. #broken-covenant #spirit #kingdom-of-darkness 

It is also interesting to note that technology (human self sufficiency through effective uses of crafts and tools) flourished during this period. The ~1,000 year period from Solomon to Jesus was the pinnacle of ancient Greek advancements. 200 years before Jesus’ birth, the Greeks had developed a mechanical calculator (analog computer), pipe organs for music, aqueducts for water and sewage, a rudimentary railway, and central heating.

Conversely, the middle ages or the “Age of Faith” reflecting the era following the nationalization of Christianity in Rome during the 300’s A.D. was far less advanced. During this 1,000 to 1,300 year period civilization moved out of the cities and into more rural areas where church leaders took over the role of education. Math and science were replaced with biblical studies (imagine that!). Of course, the church was plagued by shortcomings such as the intermingling of Christian and pagan practices, yet it seemed that society was far less concerned about short-term convenience and more interested in eternity. Go figure.

To be fair to Solomon, the Israelites had history of falling away from the Lord even after His immense blessings had enriched their lives. After the death of Joshua and after that generation had all died, the Israelites began worshipping the baals and the ashtoreths ([[Judges 2_3\|Judges 2:3]]). These demonic religions were known for their practices of animal and sometimes human sacrifices, homosexuality, and prostitution. This is a fair warning to us all of the constant effort that demons put towards distracting men and women of God from passing on the Truth of the Lord to their children. #bible-verse  #faith #church #religions #demons #truth #sons-and-daughters 

### Abomination

Sometime around 1850 A.D. an archeologist named Sir Austen Henry Layard made quite an amazing discovery. While digging in modern Iraq (Ninevah), Layard found over 20,000 clay tablets written in cuneiform that described the ancient civilizations of Babylon, Sumer, and Assyria. Much of the information was cultural and governmental, but considerably more detailed the exact history and layout of the religions of these countries.

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p> 
{ #p180}

It is difficult to fathom what was released in the spiritual realm when these tablets were discovered, and most importantly, when they were translated and read out loud. The process took over 25 years until 36 year old George Smith completed the task in 1876. He died that same year of dysentery. The translation process continues to this day as the British Museum plans to have further documenting and cataloging complete by the year 2010. It was during this initial translation period from 1851 - 1876 that several amazing events took place: the Civi War in the U.S., the Industrial Revolution, and the birth of science fiction as we know it today.

The translations revealed a little known fact that these Babylonian, Sumerian, and Assyrian religions contained one thing in common: their gods came from vessels (space ships) to earth from the stars with significant revelations of “technology.” The idea of aliens did not exist in fiction as it does today. Most cultural myths (norse / greek) had gods in the sky, but not necessarily from outer space bringing advances in knowledge. #religions #greek 

Of great importance is the fact that after these tablets were discovered, suddenly the technological advances of mankind took off like a rocket. Literally. The Industrial Revolution, combined with the fiction of notable authors such as H.G. Wells, brought a new world view to most people living in civilized countries. Wells, whose novel “The War of the Worlds” was one of the earliest examples of aliens in fiction, was a proponent of a “world state” (same as a new world order). The aliens in “The War of the Worlds” were after humans for their blood.

Today, many movies have discussed the idea of the ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians or the Mayans meeting aliens who brought them technology and were worshipped as gods. Regardless of the presentation, these stories are truly about demons, presenting themselves in human or non-human forms. It is part of the deceitful way that satan plans to bring his kingdom into power and his antichrist to the throne.

Satan’s kingdom is not outer space, it is of the air. The universe is an endless expanse of galaxies, solar systems, planets, and moon, all created for the purpose of lighting the earth, governing the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness ([[Genesis 1_16-17\|Gen. 1:16-17]]).

(Greek: wsper (hoce’-per) or, just as / exactly as)  #greek

The end times are now. Satan is working full-time to shut down the victory of Jesus at the cross and to establish his kingdom forever. His plans are truly diabolical. Exactly as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of Jesus. What was it like in the days of Noah? Fallen angels were appearing as humans and / or possessing humans and having children with them. These children infiltrated governments and brought their demonic witchcraft into the lives of the citizens, voluntarily or not. So is the plan today. #satan #jesus #kingdom #angels #demons #witchcraft 

When we see these things happening around us, we must remember our authority as royal priests. All power of the enemy comes from the sin of humans. To disarm this power, we must forgive those humans by sprinkling them with the Blood of Jesus and hurling down the accuser with the word of our testimony. When we do this, we break the power of the sin and strip the evil ones of their legal rights to bring harm. The Light of Jesus reveals the hidden sins. The Blood of Jesus breaks its power. Then we walk with the Authority of Jesus to cast the demons away and call forth the angels God has assigned us to establish the territory for the Lord.

I’ve read the end of the book. We win this war. All that is left is for us to wake up, walk in our true identities as sons and daughters of the King, and live out our birthrights / calling / purpose / destiny to the fullest of our abilities. That is, to yield to Christ within us by always responding to the Lord’s call with the answer “yes.” He called us to love. We manifest that when we forgive as Jesus did. #authority #royal-priest #sin #forgive #blood #jesus #accuser #testimony #revelation #angels #demons #god #identity #sons-and-daughters #birthright #calling #purpose #love

### The Bad Guys

The list is very long, but can be summarized as follows:

1. Pagan religions (especially those that defile)
2. Satanism
3. Witchcraft, wicca, voodoo, shaman, new age, astrology, etc.
4. Occultism and all esoteric, hidden knowledge that is only given to a select group
5. All secret societies / organizations (freemasons, odd fellows)

Needless to say, we’ve been infiltrated in the United States. Freemasonry has been around since the country’s founding. Its members include many U.S. Presidents such as George Washington. The freemasons are built around the gradual revelation of “truth,” hence their fixation of the concept of moving from darkness to light through “enlightenment” and not the Light of Jesus. The reality is that they are *combining *darkness and light (truth and lies) to pervert God’s creation. Tragically, most masons do not find this out until later in their progression from the 1st degree to the 33rd. As with most secret societies, the “secret” at the top is that the god they have been serving is none other than satan himself. #freemasons #witchcraft

This infiltration is so blatant, and yet so hidden, it is amazing. Our own one ($1) dollar bill has an egyptian pyramid on the back, unfinished, with the “eye” of horrus on top (egyptian god of the sky and thereby the sun). This symbolizes the esoteric belief of enlightenment coming to a select few and represents the

 beliefs of masonic Presidents such as the one who changed the design of the dollar bill (Franklin Delano Roosevelt). How is it possible that this country, founded by men and women of God could have such a thing on its own currency? #satan  #religions #truth #light #darkness #god #sons-and-daughters 

Most Americans call Jesus Christ Lord and Savior. According to the CIA, 77% of US citizens are Christians (http://www.cia.gov). And yet, diablo has deceived us all in believing that he calls himself defeated, is passively trying to take as many of us down with him as possible, while we are pacified with convenience and pleasant distractions and afflicted with depression, anger, fear, broken hearts, broken arms, blindness, deafness, paralysis, auto- immune disease, and cancer. #jesus #distraction #deception #sons-and-daughters #god #evil #seed #mental-health #trauma #choice #condition 

It is time for the men and women of God to defeat evil by rejecting the lies and believing the truth about who we are (identity) and what we are called to do (destiny). It is time to strip evil of its rights to manifest by fully forgiving those humans (including ourselves) who have chosen to rebel against God and sin. We must cast down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimonies, destroying every demonic stronghold and setting our siblings free. It is time to bring the Will of God to earth as it is in Heaven. We have everything we need to win. #identity #destiny #forgiveness #sin #accuser #blood #jesus #testimony #His-will #heaven #heart-of-God #rescue #restoration 

##### Two Scenarios

> [!quote]+ 
>*“But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,' and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.”* [[Matthew 24_48-50\|Matthew 24:48-50]]* #bible-verse

There are two scenarios for the Kingdom of God. The first is a bailout. The Christians fail and the enemy dominates the earth. To establish His Kingdom, Jesus returns in a rescue mission to free His fallen citizens and chain the enemy. The virgins let their lamps go out ([[Matthew 25_7-8\|Matthew 25:7-8]]). In this horrific scene, billions of people are lost to the fires of hell and the few Christians that survive do not get the privilege of seeing their true identity and

calling manifest and be released. We never get to do what we were created to do. #bible-verse  #jesus #kingdom #rescue 

In the second scenario, we bring love to the peoples of the earth and fully defeat the demonic hordes, placing them under our feet. We neutralize all power that evil uses to tempt people towards the irrational choice of death and thereby establish our upper hand. What do we do with the remaining people that have not chosen Christ as their savior? Do we strip them of their choices, freedom, or judgments? No. We love them as we love ourselves. We demonstrate to them that the banqueting table of the Lord is sweet, while sin is bitter to the taste. The virgin’s lamps were burning when the bridegroom came for them ([[Matthew 25_10\|Matt. 25:10]]). #bible-verse #love #evil #choice #freedom #judgment #bride #groom

There is a massive gap between these two scenarios. In the second, more preferable one, we get the Bride ready for her Groom. The Kingdom is established and Jesus can come to a far different Earth than in the first scenario. We can set up His throne, and welcome Him here saying, “Jesus, this is your seat over here. You see the one with your Name on it, ‘JESUS’ in big letters? That is the one. Have a seat and rule Your Kingdom. It is ready for You!” #bride #groom #kingdom #jesus

I like that scenario. That is the one I choose. We will accomplish this by Terraforming the Earth. When the Lord reveals the hidden sins in the Light of His Presence and we forgive the trespassers and cast down the accuser, we have the ability to humble the enemy under our feet and ready the Kingdom of God on Earth. That is our calling, and that is exactly what we intend to do. #terraforming #hidden #sin #light #jesus #forgiveness #accuser #calling

## Appendix: Terraforming Applied

---

> [!quote]+
> “Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you. ” [[Philippians 3_17\|Philippians 3:17]] #bible-verse 

The pattern of Terraforming gives us an outline of how the Lord wants us to pray in the adult age of the Church. It is never meant to be a formula of what to pray every time, but only to teach us ways to express what the Holy Spirit is revealing to us as we are led to the Will of the Father. When we read the Sample Prayers out loud in our prayer times with the Lord, He feeds our spirits with the words that are being expressed. Once this is a part of us, we can pray our own prayers without using the samples.

In past chapters of application, I have emphasized the importance of Terraforming yourself before you Terraform others. The sample prayer, [[Tapestry/Books/1 - Kingdom/Terraforming for the Kingdom#Sample Prayer Self (Adulthood)\|Self (Adulthood)]] is one of the best of these to date for just this purpose. It is also important to begin Terraforming in your own sphere of influence, especially your immediate family, extended family, home, work, church, and local retail spaces. #terraforming #pray #prayer #adult-season #holy-spirit #revelation #His-will #church 

I am shouting from the mountain tops, begin Terraforming in groups! Join together, become accountable to one another. Progress to deeper places in your own heart. Ask the Lord for the authority needed to pray over wider areas. The Lord wants to expand your tent pegs! He wants you to branch out! But for this to happen safely, we are exhorted to assemble as a body. You are a hand.  God wants to attach you to a wrist, elbow, and upper

<br>
arm. He wants to attach your arm to the torso across town where the legs are headed now. As is another arm that looks just like yours does, but has an opposable function with yours.

The Lord commands a blessing when we are unified (Psalm 133). When we begin to see groups of adult sons and daughters of God gather together in holiness to pray over the land, their cities, their region, and their countries we will see the planet change. Jesus was on his own. He was the prototype. We are called to do everything that He did in unity. We then will truly become the body of Christ. Multiple children of God that fit together perfectly to make up one new man in Christ. We are literally to become Jesus on earth when this happens. The time is now. Think of it as a square dance. Step one is to find your partner... #terraforming #heart #heart-of-God #invitation #rescue #adult-season #sons-and-daughters #pray #jesus

*Father, I ask you to shine Your Light in my life. I ask you to come Lord Jesus, Lion of the Tribe of Judah and stake Your claim in my being that there would be no darkness, no hiding place for the enemy. I ask you to reveal all of the hidden things in the Light of Your Presence. Father, you know what I can handle at one time and what would be too much. I ask you to give me this day my daily bread of revelation through Your Light. I ask you, Holy Spirit to lead me to the Will of the Father that through the discernment of Your Voice, all of my prayers might be founded in Truth. I give You the glory and honor in all things.”* #prayer #light #jesus #sample-prayer

##### STEP TWO: The Blood of Jesus

*“Father, I repent of every time I have fallen short of Your Glory <note: be specific with all things revealed to you by the Holy Spirit from this point on>. I receive Your forgiveness. I ask You Lord Jesus to wash my feet with Your own Blood so that the power of all my sins is broken. I call these sins dead. I am **purified** of all unrighteousness, **redeemed** so that all things work together for good, and my access to You is fully **restored**. I ask You Lord to remember my sins no more so that I would be found holy and blameless in Your sight. And as You remember these sins no more, I ask that You would take away the pain of my sins from any person that I harmed in doing so. I cancel and strip all rights of the evil one to torment and afflict us for these sins. I hurl down the accuser by the Blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony.”* #prayer #blood #jesus #sample-prayer

##### STEP THREE: The Authority of Jesus

*“All conspiracies of evil are thwarted. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. I ask you Lord to come, All Consuming Fire, to burn any deposits left by the evil one away: any seeds, implantations, or fruit that there would be no trace of evil in my life. I call all portals, doors, or gates off-limits to the enemy camp. Father, I enforce all angelic assignments that You have given me. I receive all guardian and ministering angels that You have sent to me and the messages they carry. I choose to enter Your Presence with clean hands and a pure heart by the Blood of Jesus.

All portals, doors, and gates are off-limits to the enemy camp. Father, we enforce all angelic assignments that You have given us. We post those angels in strategic order: sentry and sentinel angels at the doors. Warring angels around the perimeter of the property, and guarding angels with each child of God. We receive all ministering angels that You have sent to us. We call this place a stronghold for the Kingdom of God. The gates of hell will not prevail here. Finally, Lord we welcome Your Presence in this place. We ask You to be the love, peace, joy, and faith within each of us here today. Amen.”* #prayer #authority #jesus #sample-prayer

With the Authority You have given us, I demand of the enemy camp that all hidden plans be exposed in the Light of Your Presence. All attempts at deception, division, and destruction whether in progress or in thought only, must be completely disclosed in full detail.

##### STEP TWO: The Blood of Jesus

*“Father, we forgive Jim, his parents, grandparents, and his great-grandparents. We forgive his wife, Cathy and her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. We forgive all those that have trespassed against them. We wash their feet with the Blood of Jesus so that the power of their sins is broken. All curses are broken. All sins of defilement: bloodshed, broken covenant, idolatry, and sexual immorality are washed away. All wounds are healed. Everything false is revealed in Your Light, Father, and forgiven. All covenants, oaths, or vows of evil are dissolved. All witchcraft, manipulation, or control is dismantled, unraveled, undone, and rendered powerless.

We demand a cease-fire on all deception in his life, effective immediately. All conspiracies against them are thwarted. No weapons formed against them shall prosper. We close all portals, gates, doors, or windows of evil. We ask You, Father to burn any residue from their lives, any seeds, implantations, or any fruit. We call the memory of sin erased from the matter of earth. We ask You Lord to heal them of all habits, reflexes, or instincts that have formed in their personalities around the pain of these sins. We thank You Lord that the pain is now gone.”*

I am Yours.”*

*“Father, I ask You to create in me a heart for Our Family that when the prodigals come home, I will celebrate with you.

Our Family has grown and will be greater because of these last-minute hires. I ask You to baptize me with Your Holy Spirit of Love so that I might go and do all that Jesus demonstrated for us to do. Amen.”*

### Sample Prayer: Splinter Souls

*“Father, Thank You for Your Light that has revealed the hidden root sins in my life. I am Your child, and You have called me a royal priest.

I sprinkle each one with the Blood of Jesus and the power of <self-pity, despair, anger, self-protection, fear, self-destruction, self-gratification, independence from God> is broken. They are purified of this unrighteousness; they are redeemed of every consequence. And I am restored to the person of God that I was created to be: whole and complete, unified and integrated.

I welcome back the wounded little boy, the frightened child, the rebellious teenager, the addict, and the adult bully back into my being, fully free of all sin. Thanks be to Jesus Christ, King.”*

Those who lied to me, stole from me, falsely accused me, or tried to destroy me. I also forgive my forefathers and every person that we have been in covenant with. I forgive every person that has trespassed against my family. I sprinkle each one of these with the Blood of Jesus and the power of these sins is broken. Every curse is broken. All defilement is washed away. Every heart wound is healed and the victims are set free. All fear and anger are washed away. Everything false is revealed in the Light, forgiven and washed away. All vows, oaths, or covenants of evil, or with evil are dissolved. And all witchcraft is dismantled, unraveled, undone, and rendered powerless. Father, as You have remembered these sins no more, I pray that the memory of these sins would be erased from the matter of earth. I welcome Your all-consuming fire to burn any residue away. All*

### Sample Prayer: Soul Healing

#### Soul Armor

*Heavenly Father, I repent and ask You to forgive me for protecting myself with soul armor. I receive the Blood of Jesus that my own personal armor would lose its power and stand down. I receive Your armor in replacement and ask You to hide me in the shelter of Your wings. I am purified and redeemed. I hurl down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony.”*

#### Soul Valves

*“By the Blood of Jesus and the word of my testimony I declare that the accuser is hurled down in my life. I have received forgiveness and forgiven my forefathers, all those we have been in covenant with, and all those who have trespassed against us. All witchcraft is rendered powerless. All heart wounds are healed and the resulting impact of soul reliance is undone. With the authority given to me by Jesus, I call the intake valves in my soul to fully open so that all things imparted to my spirit where it sits in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus will flow freely into my soul. Equally, I declare that the out-take valves in my soul to fully open so that these things and all those that come in from my body will not be trapped like a lake but will flow out of me like a river. The world will receive the fruit of my being from this free flow from heaven through my spirit, into my soul, and out of my body.”*

#### SOUL HABITS 
(mature, adult son or daughter of God only) 

*“Heavenly Father, now that the sin in my life has been washed away and all rights of the evil one are stripped by the Blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony, I ask that You would instantaneously heal me of all soul habits so the work of God may be displayed in my life. Heal me of every way that my mind, will, and emotions have learned to walk in these sins.*

*For those habits that You would have me break through the discipline of learned behavior, I ask that You would cover me with an incubator of grace. I ask that You would shine Your Light on those men or women that You would bring into my life to stand with me as siblings or as a spiritual father. I ask You to keep me safe and loved in this process. That You would identify

ways for us to set boundaries around behavior and methods of accountability so my soul cannot hide its mistakes in dark places. When consequences are needed, I ask that You would reveal to me the loving, yet effective method that I can authorize my sibling or spiritual father to carry out. I ask You to lead us in this process fully, so that we will stay in perfect alignment with Your Will and Your everlasting covenant with David. I ask You to keep us from sin in this process. We trust You fully and ask You to walk with us through this healing.”*

I ask You for the grace to walk out the revelation You have given us to bring the Body of Christ to a place of unity where we can have strength in our numbers to win the world for the Kingdom of God. I ask You to grant to us the keys to win over massive numbers of gentiles who believe in false gods today or no god at all. And most importantly, I ask You to release to us the keys to see our Hebrew brothers and sisters enter into this new covenant with our God. That the Jewish people would be restored to us and we would finally become the one new man you spoke to Paul about by revelation. We declare by faith that Your will is done on earth as it is in Heaven, giving You all the glory. Amen.”*

#### Bundled

I hurl down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. Amen.”*
