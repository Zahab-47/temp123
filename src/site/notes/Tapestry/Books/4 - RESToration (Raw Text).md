What is Terraforming? 

The wages of sin are death (Rom. 6:23), but if you sin, you do not immediately die; you decay unto death. Satan, as a serpent, used this to deceive Eve and ultimately Adam (Gen. 3:1–6). To this day, satan gets power and authority (Luke 4:6) to bring decay to creation every time a person chooses selfishness (sins). According to Jesus, this was true before the cross (Luke 10:19) and after (Acts 26:17–18). 

Terraforming in the Kingdom is the process by which the sons and daughters of God liberate creation from the bondage of decay (Rom. 8:19–21). We release creation into its irrevocable calling (Rom. 11:29) through the impartation of authority given to us through the fulfillment of the prophecy of Revelation 12. Jesus promised that He would give us Keys to the Kingdom one day in the future (Matt. 16:19). When the Church gave birth to its adulthood (Rev. 12:5), we were given these Keys to usher creation into the completion of its covenant with the One who loves us! 

KEY ONE: We pursue the daily bread portion of our Father’s will done that He sets aside for us each day (Matt. 6:10–11). This includes revelation, discernment, Truth, freedom, deliverance, healing, provision, and inheritance. 

KEY TWO: We ask the Lord to shine the Light of His Presence. The Light reveals the hidden sins (Ps. 90:8) that give satan power in the world (Luke 4:6, Acts 26:18) to bring decay that leads to death (Rom. 6:23) and makes us unclean (Lam. 1:8). This is the decay that creation is in bondage to (Rom. 8:21).

KEY THREE: Then, as royal priests (1 Pet. 2:9), who are commissioned by Jesus and filled with the Holy Spirit, we liberate creation from decay by forgiving people who’ve sinned (John 20:21–23), with the blood of Jesus (Heb. 9:22, Lev. 17:11) and the word of our testimony, thus hurling down the accuser (Rev. 12:10–11). Our testimony is what the blood of Jesus does for us: we are purified (1 John 1:7), redeemed (Eph. 1:7), and restored back to God (Eph. 2:13). The sins are then considered “put to death” (Col. 3:5, 1 Pet. 2:24). This is the fullness of forgiveness. 

KEY FOUR: Finally, we remove evil with the authority of Jesus (Luke 10:19), tearing down their spiritual strongholds (2 Cor. 10:4). Because the rights of the kingdom of darkness have been stripped away, they have no house to return to (Matt. 12:44, Mark 9:25). We are able to command the evil ones not to eavesdrop on our Kingdom conversations and require that all schemes of evil be disclosed—all as a fruit of forgiveness (2 Cor. 2:10–11). We declare and release creation’s irrevocable call of destiny into being so we can see our Father’s will for love accomplished!

Introduction

“‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,’ the Lord replied. ‘Now get up and stand on your feet. . . . I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.’” Acts 26:15b–16a,17–18 

Even after our Lord Jesus was crucified, declared, “It is finished,” and was resurrected, satan still had authority and power. While we all wish this weren’t true, Jesus confirmed it twice: once with the disciples before Calvary and once afterward with the apostle Paul. In Acts 26, Paul quotes Jesus from his Damascus road encounter, saying that satan has exousia (Strong’s G1849), the Greek word for ‘authority,’ which literally means “authority to rule” or “one whose commands must be submitted to.”

“I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.” Luke 10:19 Jesus said that the ‘enemy,’ echthros (G2190), who is the devil, also has ‘power.’ The Greek word used by Luke is dunamis (G1411), which means “ability, strength, power, and influence from resources.” This authority and power was handed over to satan when Adam and Eve first sinned (Luke 4:6). Why did Jesus indicate that satan still has authority and power after all that was accomplished on the cross? Because we are still sinning. Every

time a human falls short of God’s glory and operates outside of the Father’s will, satan receives power and authority to bring decay to creation. 

This is satan’s motivation for accusing the priests (Zech. 3:1) and people before God day and night (Rev. 12:10–11). The enemy doesn’t want you to know this. As long as we believe satan is powerless and beaten, we will continue to accuse God of giving us things like genetic disorders, depression, and cancer. Now that we know the truth, we’re stripping evil of its authority and power by fully forgiving those who have sinned, hurling down the accuser with the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony! 

“While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped Him in cloths and placed Him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.” Luke 2:6–7 (NIV 1984) 

The Lord prepares a place in advance for His will to be done. Despite this, humans make choices that sometimes conflict with God’s will and prevent His assigned resources from being released for their intended purposes. However, this doesn’t stop God. He is much greater than that! He always has layers of backup plans to see His will done. No greater example of this was the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. God highlighted the inn to Joseph and Mary, but no room was found. The Lord then took them to the manger, where the King of kings was born. The manger was not God’s original design, so He used what was available to get the job done. 

We see this happening today with many messages the Lord is giving His children. It’s amazing to me how many movies we’ve seen in the last few years that are pictures of what He’s doing or about to do in the Kingdom. Yet, many of these movies aren’t coming from followers of Jesus who spent intimate time with the Father soaking in His Presence. These ideas are coming to movie producers who, in many cases, are downright hostile to God. On top of that, the Church often doesn’t recognize these inspired messages and judges the films as evil!

When the Lord began to release the collective adulthood of the Church, there was no adult wineskin available to release it in. This didn’t stop God, but He had to use an adolescent wineskin to release His new wine, despite a very high risk of the old skin bursting. The Lord knows what must be done and how it impacts eternity. He knows how to prioritize what is urgent over what is important. 

We’re all being given choices in this season. They all boil down to whether we’ll accept God’s daily invitations or fall away. Will we let go of our beliefs, needs, and desires and lay them at God’s feet? Are we willing to be naked before our Creator so He can clothe us in white? We must persist and hold true to our choice to yield to Him. God may alter the plan and change directions. Are we listening to Him or holding on to the original plan, thinking we’re doing the right thing? Battle on! He loves us so much and wants us to finish well! Remember, He believes in us! 

“For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus.” Revelation 19:10b 

One of the greatest misconceptions about prophecy is that it’s intended to tell us the future. However, God always connects the future with our choices. Our free will must be preserved to fulfill His definition of Love. Prophecies are given as pictures that need to be interpreted. Their translation is always meant to occur in their season of fulfillment, when the choices required for them to happen have already been made. It’s satan who wants to tell us what’s going to happen regardless of our choices, thus influencing or even controlling what we choose and how we act in the future. 

Prophecy is given to the Lord’s priests as a part of the process of revelation. These words are meant to fit together in a sequence that can be interpreted in many different ways. Some prophecies are very weird sounding. Those written at the Lord’s leading thousands of years ago must be discerned by our spirits. So often, we see translators attempting to predict the future by interpreting prophecies instead of (a) receiving revelation from God, (b) taking the risk of living it out and bearing fruit, and then (c) allowing the prophecies to be a testimony that confirms what we already received. The book of Revelation is a prime

example of this. While it’s true the Lord has used the book to provide warnings to His people, much of what John wrote was intended to confirm things as they happen. 

Our understanding of the Bible is greatly skewed by translations that came from people’s minds instead of direct revelation from God into their spirits. This is how the Church gets into time- wasting and divisive debates about things like a pre- vs. post- tribulation rapture. Due to the extensive influence of scholars and theologians interpreting prophecies outside their season of fulfillment, a revolution must occur. We’re about to have a dramatic change in our understanding, as the Lord is releasing the truth of these prophecies as a testimony of what we’re currently experiencing. 

In the next few years, the sons and daughters of God will be given choices about whether they’ll lay down their lives so they can receive His. We get to choose whether we pursue our daily bread of His will done or our will in our timing. If we pursue His will being done daily, the global harvest of Revelation 14:14–16 will be massive (in the billions), and creation will be greatly liberated from the bondage of decay. If we choose our will done, we will see a much smaller global harvest. Just remember, God only needed a handful of righteous people, those who yield to His will daily, to rescue Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 18:32). Can you imagine if there were millions of us willing to lay down our lives? 

“And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.” Revelation 14:3 

When we were children, we often learned new things in the form of daily assignments. Our mom might have said, “Okay, today we are going to learn how to tie our shoelaces.” On another day, our dad might have said, “Today’s assignment is learning how to brush our teeth.” Each assignment produced a new behavior. In our adult life, we don’t see many of those early tasks as assignments anymore; we’ve already developed the behavior. We would look pretty funny, exclaiming to the world, “It’s a busy day today. I’ve rolled up my sleeves and prepared myself for the

task at hand. I’m emotionally stable enough for the job and will likely be paid overtime. What am I going to do? I’m going to brush—my—teeth!!!” Not hardly. These things have become a small part of our greater lifestyle. 

In the collective adulthood of the Church, the Father is bringing us new wine, and we are learning a new song: He is teaching us to pursue our daily bread and yield our lives to His will done. He is showing us how to lay down our lives daily by making choices of selflessness. We’re also being given assignments to minister to others in formal (but very effective) prayer appointments. We’re gathering in unity for assignments to pursue daily bread of our Father’s will done for all creation. We’re seeing massive atmosphere changes across regions, and all of creation is responding. Our song is echoing throughout Heaven with a beauty not heard before. 

Today’s assignments will be tomorrow’s lifestyle. Very soon, we’ll begin new tasks that stretch us even further than we’ve already gone! We’ll receive new revelation and discernment. We’ll take new risks of faith and produce new fruit and testimonies of what “eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor mind conceived.” Our Father has a plan, and we are quickly realizing it’s much bigger than we thought. One day, we’ll look back, and the things we learned today will have become our lifestyle! A lifestyle of rest. 

Our understanding of rest must be made anew. For so many of us, we believe rest is like dessert. We ate our meat and veggies, and now we deserve and are entitled to eat sugar and fat. Likewise, many of us believe that rest is a period of physical immobility we earn from working six days a week. That may be true in the world but not so in the Kingdom. In the Kingdom, rest is for our soul. Our mind, will, and emotions are on permanent vacation, lying on a beach and soaking in the sun. All worries are laid at the feet of Jesus as we yield our lives to daily portions of our Father’s will. Our souls still operate but at peace. We have true rest because all condemnation and burden is replaced by our faith and trust in our Father’s will being accomplished when we ask it of Him. Our bodies, on the other hand, will be working overtime.

Chapter One 

Rest 

“In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength.” Isaiah 30:15b 

Welcome to adulthood! Yes, we’re all grown up, and it’s a new day. Everything seems different. We’re noticing things we’ve been familiar with our whole lives, yet they are not the same. It’s hard to put into words, but creation feels different. Life is moving at an incredibly accelerated rate. Miracles that used to happen every five years now happen every five hours and sometimes every five minutes! Breakthrough comes in days instead of years. Fruit grows the next day, not the next decade. The harvest being produced is many times more than what we’ve seen in the past. How on earth do we bring perspective to what is happening around us? 

It’s important to acknowledge we’ve suddenly been given a far greater context for life than the human race has had before. It’s all starting to make sense! We can see the bird’s eye view of why certain things have happened, how we’re meant to operate in them, and to some degree, what our future will look like. Creation has not changed; we have! When our spirits, individually and corporately, reached maturity, we obtained a new level of access not seen before in history.

The Church was created to grow up and look like Jesus. It’s that simple. Isn’t that wonderful? There’s a lot of good news for us to celebrate. We can now walk in the identity the Lord wrote on our hearts when He created us. We’re mature enough for the anointing, authority, and power the Lord wants and needs us to receive from Him. Now is the time of the “greater works” that Jesus prophesied we would see (John 14:12). 

It’s time for us to move ahead from the works of dismantling evil, which we have covered extensively, and on to the identity of adults. Once we understand who we are and the authority and power we walk in, we can learn to be God’s men and women, adult sons and daughters created to establish His will done on the earth. It’s a huge calling and mighty responsibility but not a place of burden. Our first step lies in our choice to rest. 

“For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.” 1 Corinthians 3:11 

Although we’re now adults, living in our own house, so to speak, we still carry the DNA of our Father. We have reached maturity and received great authority and power. We’re responsible enough to be entrusted with the riches of the Kingdom. Nonetheless, the soil of Christ is in our very foundation, and He only did what He saw His Father doing in Heaven. There are certain things that don’t change or go away as we grow up. These are critical to staying grounded in Him as we go forward. We must remain true to our roots to keep from being led astray. 

RIGHTEOUSNESS

“But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.” Matthew 6:33 

The first characteristic of God’s adult sons and daughters is that we’re tough on sin. This isn’t to say we’re imprisoned by self- sourced salvation, chained by the Law, and living in the spirit of slavery. It’s a familial view of sin that comes from the spirit of sonship. We understand that every time a human is selfish, it gives power and authority to the evil one and the kingdom of this world. We’re not a part of that kingdom but the heavenly

 Kingdom of our Father. How can we work to rescue our family and defeat the marauders who kidnapped them if we’re feeding the evil ones with our power and authority? We cannot. 
 
 “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.” Matthew 5:6 
 
 You know an adult son or daughter of God when you see one: they’re hungry for righteousness. We’ve learned that pleasure and comfort are not prerequisites of Love. Sometimes, we have neither, but we still walk with the Lord. Sometimes, we have both abundantly, but that doesn’t mean they’re mandatory companions for our relationship with the Father. The enemy uses pleasure and comfort as a temptation and threat to our souls. The world teaches the flesh to hunger for them, but they aren’t eternal treasures. Our hearts lie with the Lord: all that is Love and eternal. We seek first the Kingdom and His righteousness, and then, we rest, knowing all other things will be given to us: 
 
 “He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be My son. But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.” Revelation 21:7–8 (NIV 1984) 
 
 DISCERNMENT AND REVELATION
 
  “The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.” 1 Corinthians 2:14 (NIV 1984) 
  
  Discernment is one of the most missed and ignored benefits of the Spirit. This wonderful and amazing gift is for the Lord’s children and is mandatory for the Body of Christ to walk in its full destiny. The biggest issue concerning discernment is that it’s often been misunderstood and shut down. Routinely, we contemplate things with our minds and draw conclusions or create logical theories. These actions of the soul usually relate to facts seen in the natural, not inspired understanding coming from the Lord through our spirits.

When you discern things spiritually, you perceive the invisible. When we walk on defiled land, discerners can identify the specific defilement. If violence occurred on the land, the person may be aware of a manic irritation. If sexual immorality occurred on the land, the person may discern lust. These perceptions of discernment have often been falsely believed to be a problem coming from the discerning person. The enemy has used these gifts against us to condemn and bring us great burdens of guilt when we perceive sin that isn’t ours but is remembered in land or came from a nearby person. 

We must identify those in the Church who’ve been given this gift and release them into their calling of hearing what the Lord says. In our travels, we’ve found many discerners have been shut down by authority figures (spouse, pastor, etc.) who primarily operate out of the soul. When hearing an opposing view from a discerner that seems illogical or even irrational, these authorities rely on logic to make determinations. Regardless, those in authority must make room for, test, and then receive words from those with discernment.

“I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.” Galatians 1:11–12 (NIV 1984) 

Revelation is far more accepted in the Church today but still not completely. We must all learn to hear the Lord’s voice and receive His messages. Revelation mostly involves gaining understanding from God about something hidden or veiled. Much of the time, a fresh understanding was only hidden from the individual receiving the revelation; it wasn’t a corporate veiling. However, in corporate adulthood, we’re seeing many things unveiled the Church hasn’t understood since its inception. 

Both revelation and discernment are mandatory for the Church to fully mature. The Lord has a will in every moment we’re alive. We must be able to hear Him speak it to us so that we can follow Him wherever He leads. That means having intimate time with the Lord so we’re listening and then taking risks of faith. In those moments, we can learn how to hear Him and then act on what we’ve heard.

YIELDING 

“‘Now then,’ said Joshua, ‘throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the Lord, the God of Israel.’” Joshua 24:23 

When you mature in the world’s system, you eventually leave your parents and don’t depend on them like you once did. This isn’t the case in the Kingdom of God. Every time we walk in our power and authority, it comes from the Lord. Our maturity is defined by how we’ve learned to represent Him on Earth. He is God and King here through us. That’s how much He trusts us! He is all-knowing and ever-present, and each individual in His Kingdom is meant to do his or her part to ensure God’s plan is accomplished: 

“My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work. John 4:34 

“Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven; [of Your will done,] give us today our daily bread.” Matthew 6:10–11 

There is no punctuation in the original Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. In Matthew’s verse above, I’ve indicated what I hear the Lord saying. We’re called to yield to God, receiving our daily bread of His will done. All sons and daughters operating in the Church’s corporate adulthood will live this way in everything. We recognize that He’s assigned a part for us to play. The Church is the Body, and each individual has a smaller function. The sum of the functions is the operation of the Body as a whole. By yielding to the Lord and seeking His will done in daily bread portions, we make way for Him to see His plan accomplished! The whole Church will overcome and win the race only when each part of the Body yields to the Head. 

In our spiritual adolescence, we learned some bad habits. These mindsets must change as we walk in adulthood. The first bad habit is praying something like, “Give us this day our pain relieved.” This request goes back to striving for comfort and is not an adult mindset. While it could be the Lord’s will for your pain to be suddenly relieved, we’re not motivated by self-interest

anymore. A second example, “Give us this day our problem solved,” is of the same root. While it’s true the Lord likes to solve our problems, His adult children are focused on the needs of the Body as a whole. Today may not be the day our particular problem or pain gets solved. There may be other priorities that need to occur first. The final example is, “Give us this day our promises fulfilled.” While the Lord always fulfills promises, we must understand that everything has a context, that is, a greater setting than what we see in just our individual lives. 

“In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost.” Matthew 18:14 (NIV 1984) 

Our Father is managing all of creation. He holds the delicate universe in His hands while addressing six to seven billion children created in His image, all with the free will to choose Love or not-Love. He knows what must happen when it should, how much should happen, and who should help it happen. When we yield to His wisdom and power, He does mighty things. It’s true that God is sovereign, but as His children, we have a far larger role than we’ve been led to believe. 

“Then [Abraham] said, ‘May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten [righteous people] can be found there?’ [The Lord] answered, ‘For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.’” Genesis 18:32 

“Righteous people” are adult sons and daughters of God who yield to Him, gratefully receiving their daily bread of His will done. Through a handful of these people, He can change the world. He can save a city. He can rescue a kidnapped daughter. Can you imagine what would happen if the Lord had one thousand righteous people? One million? One hundred million? One billion? What would the world look like? One thing I know for sure: those who yield to God and receive their daily bread of His will done—even only 365 daily breads from today—won’t recognize themselves. 

“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.” Proverbs 3:5–6

 There’s no greater rest than when we hand every expectation over to God and trust Him. He wants us to be content, knowing that He’ll carry the burdens while we get to rest in Him. As our souls rest, our bodies can work overtime! There is no busier person than the righteous sons and daughters of God. The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. As such, we are at work everywhere we go. Even in our sleep, many of our spirits are translated to other places, even other nations, to continue working during the nighttime hours, but our souls are at rest. 
 
 “This is what the Lord says: ‘Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls.’” Jeremiah 6:16
 
  INQUIRING OF THE LORD 
  
  “So David inquired of God: ‘Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will You hand them over to me?’ The Lord answered him, ‘Go, I will hand them over to you.’” 1 Chronicles 14:10 
  
  It’s shocking to realize how many times we make decisions without asking the Lord what His thoughts are. All sorts of threats, challenges, and problems face us every day. Do we stop and ask, “What is Your will in this?” If we do, we make room for Him to establish His desire. Daily bread shouldn’t be confined to every twenty-four hours. It means moment by moment, every day. If we inquire of the Lord in everything and wait upon Him, He will move in our lives to ensure His will is done. Then, we’ll see that all things will work for good in our lives.
  
   “During the reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the Lord.” 2 Samuel 21:1a
   
King David is known for being a very successful warrior. He was blessed in everything he set his hands to when he inquired of the Lord. Whenever headed to war, he sought God. When the Philistines attacked the Valley of Rephaim after David was crowned Israel’s king, he inquired and defeated them like “waters break out.” Shortly thereafter, they attacked again. This time, when David inquired, God gave him specific instructions.

This supernatural understanding of how to defeat his enemies gave him an upper hand that no one could come against. During three years of famine, David sought the Lord’s face and was given specific reasons for why it occurred and instructions for how to resolve it. 

“It was because you, the Levites, did not bring [the ark] up the first time that the Lord our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of Him about how to do it in the prescribed way.” 1 Chronicles 15:13 

When David was threatened by famine or war, he inquired. Yet, when facing decisions that seemed non-threatening, he did not. In those cases, the ways that felt good, such as lust and pride, guided him. These were the times of his greatest failures. The Lord wants us to seek Him in all things. The most memorable missteps in David’s reign are directly related to him acting without the Lord.

Adulthood means we’re entrusted with great power and authority, but the consequences of our mistakes are staggering. We must be sobered by David’s example: one mistake, one act of pride, resulted in the deaths of seventy thousand Israelites. While this may seem like an Old Testament anomaly, there’s nothing further from the truth. As God’s adult children, filled with the Holy Spirit, yielding to daily bread of His will, we must inquire throughout our day to ensure that our use of His authority and power doesn’t cause mass destruction.

 David proceeded with a sinful census in 2 Samuel 24:1. Then, in verse 8, he repented. In verses 9–10, the Lord outlined discipline for David; in verse 12, the adult king chose his own consequence. In verse 14, we see the Lord’s justice as seventy thousand are killed by plague. Finally, in verse 15, we see the mercy of the Lord as Jerusalem is spared when the angel is ordered to stop. As adults, we take responsibility for our actions. The ramifications are extreme. We, therefore, pursue righteousness, not fueling the fire that God has called us to put out. We yield to our daily bread portion of His will done, allowing our souls to rest in this place of peace. Finally, we inquire of the Lord in all things, making way for Him to come with supernatural miracles, signs, and wonders that demonstrate His love for us. 
 
 “Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” Matthew 11:28
 
  KEY 
  
  God’s adult sons and daughters are hungry for righteousness. They listen to and hear the Shepherd’s voice. They freely choose to yield their lives, inquiring of Him for their daily bread of His will done in all creation. As a result, they rest!

Chapter Two

Love 

“My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.” John 15:12 

In previous books, we defined love from a bird’s eye view, the big picture, a macro level. On an interpersonal level, we can further define love as a relationship of eternal, unconditional, selfless truth, affection, and support. Conversely, evil is simply defined as completely self-centered choices, thoughts, actions, and behavior. We learned that when God designed creation, He set the stage for love to be manifested through the revelation of the lover and loved of God. That is us, the maturing sons and daughters of God! Our Father intended for love to require two basic components to ensure it was genuine: free choice and faith. Without these, love is mechanical and meaningless, void of all substance and power. 

Unless we have the freedom to choose, we’re not capable of loving by our Father’s definition. Tragically, the Christian religion has stripped the fullness of this from its followers. The religion has taught people that acceptance from the Father comes from performance. In this lie of the enemy, God’s love is conditional and based upon our abstinence from certain actions deemed sin. Nothing could be further from the Truth. Our Father accepts and loves us without condition, so much that He gave His only begotten Son so that all conditions would be fully met.

 “As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Now remain in My love. If you keep My commands, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commands and remain in His love. I have told you this so that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. You are My friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from My Father I have made known to you. You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in My name the Father will give you. This is My command: Love each other.” John 15:9–17

In this passage, Jesus isn’t saying that if you obey His commands, He’ll love you. He’s indicating that when you freely choose to believe in Him, you enter a covenant with His Father, who is Love (1 John 4:8). Choosing Jesus and, therefore, the Father, is choosing Love. Then, when we choose Love, we’re obeying His command. When we choose Jesus, He also takes us deeper in intimacy with our Father, not just once but daily. This is how we learn the Master’s business: by sitting at His table. By choosing God (Love) daily, our intimacy with Him deepens, causing us to bear fruit—which means we’re loving others, too. 

“Jesus replied, ‘The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves Me must follow Me; and where I am, My servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves Me.’” John 12:23–26 

Love matures from a simple choice to a love like no other when we lay down our lives for people. To understand that choice, we must define what life we’re laying down and losing. Jesus wasn’t exclusively referring to martyrdom. He said this just before He was crucified, so we may think that, by definition, “losing our life” means we’re all called to die physically. Rather, from birth

and childhood, many of our choices are self-centered and, therefore, evil (Gen. 8:21). From a heart of self-focus, we build a life based upon ourselves. Our Father is calling us to give that life up so we can gain His life for us! 

When we lay down our self-life, allowing it to fall to the ground and die, we receive His life, which produces much fruit in the form of rescuing our siblings from captivity! Jesus didn’t have a selfishly focused life to give up; His earthly call was to die in the natural. For us, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few (Matt. 9:37). The Father wants to place all His sons and daughters in their field of harvest! We’re called to lose our self- made life so we can master our irrevocable gifts and apply them in our calling: liberating creation from the bondage of decay. 

FAITH FROM INTIMACY 

If God were visible, it would be impossible for us not to choose Him. Since that would affect our freedom of choice, the Father hid Himself so our choices could be authentic. As such, we can see faith as a prerequisite of Love. When we take a risk and choose to believe in something we cannot see, hear, smell, taste, or feel, we demonstrate faith. The same holds true when we believe in something that cannot be proven. 

Christians have taken ownership of or been labeled with the word “faith,” and it’s part of the chasm between belief in God and atheism. Yet, the true definition of faith can be described as “belief despite uncertainty.” This simple definition helps us find common ground with atheists by starting with mutual empathy instead of focusing on our differences and judging one another. It’s human nature to want our beliefs to be proven. 

This is true among those who believe in God (or “gods”) and those who don’t. However, it’s time for His sons and daughters to be set free from that self-centered need. We must learn that there is no such thing as proof. Every year, we have scientists who propose new theories, and every year, we have scientists who disprove old theories. To say it nicely, “We guess, until we learn better.” Is there anything that we can be one hundred percent certain of? I think not. No matter how we define what we learn, there’s always a degree of uncertainty.

Without the ability to prove anything beyond a shadow of a doubt, all human beings experience faith every day. Once we truly understand this, we can stop living the lie that the risk needed to have faith is frightening. We’ll start to realize that faith is at the foundation of all we are. For example, when we receive the gift of a testimony of God’s goodness, we don’t need for the testimony to be factually “proven” by our eyes seeing a picture or video, our ears hearing the word of a doctor, or by tasting the manna from Heaven ourselves. We can simply trust God with the testimony and give Him glory, honor, and praise!!! 

“A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign.” Matthew 16:4a 

Without proof, how do we keep from being deceived? First, we mustn’t look for signs as our reason to believe. Miracles, signs, wonders, and testimonies are blessings to be expected from a Kingdom of power, but they’re not a prerequisite of belief. That requirement is a mindset of satan, who has deceived Christians into a relationship with God founded on the filter of their mind. Maturing sons and daughters of God, who are confident in their identity, can make choices based purely on faith. We choose to believe in God and what He says to us. Miracles, signs, wonders, and testimonies are icing on the cake! We celebrate them because we expect them from our almighty Father! 

“God is spirit, and His worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.” John 4:24 

We keep from being deceived by growing in our spirits through an intimate relationship with our Father. We must spend time with Him to learn to hear His voice in the quietest of moments. We must discern with our spirits when we’re presented with miracles, signs, wonders, and testimonies to know whether they’re from the Lord or not (1 Cor. 2:14). God’s adult sons and daughters have their Father as their source of everything. Through this mature relationship they are “not deceived by those who are false” (Matt. 24:24). All choices made in faith are filled with great power. The fruit that comes from them is enhanced with supernatural “fertilizer” that creates a greater yield in quantity, size, and quality. Risk is

the rocket fuel of faith. The greater the risk associated with choices of faith, the greater the yield of fruit. When the Lord presents us with a risky choice, it’s an opportunity worthy of great celebration! He is giving us the blessing of an abundant harvest. Adult sons and daughters of God see and are grateful for this gift from our Father! 

Jesus’ death was when He was glorified. We, too, are glorified when we lose our self-life to gain His life in us. Our Father is growing us to become worthy of being the lover and loved of God. When we totally and freely choose Love despite uncertainty, moving in faith, we produce great fruit and creation is liberated. We can fully choose Love as we rest, yielding to our Father’s will done in daily bread portions. Moment by moment, we lay down our self-life for His. We trust Him even though there are reasons to doubt. 

When we were young in the Lord, we saw Jesus’ life as glorious because He was the only Son of God. Now, we understand that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God. Through our belief in Him, we have eternal life. By daily choosing Love, we bear fruit and become God’s sons and daughters, designed to mature and receive an inheritance. Through a growing relationship with our Father, spending time with Him, and yielding to His goodness, we know that His life in us will be glorious, too. 

MIRACLE OF REPENTANCE 

“Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of His miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. ‘Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.’” Matthew 11:20–22 

We will see many miracles, signs, and wonders in the Church's adulthood. By far, the greatest of these supernatural blessings will be changed hearts! As the Lord sends us into the world as trusted sons and daughters, more and more, we’ll see that the fruit of our labor is a greater work than what Jesus saw (John 14:12). This will become apparent as the evil one’s deception is

dismantled, people see the Truth, and freely choose Him. As they do, their hearts and their lives will be changed forever. What a life God has given us! The Father is saying, “Come rest in daily portions of My life for you today!” 

“At that time Jesus said, ‘I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what You were pleased to do. All things have been committed to Me by My Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him. Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.’” Matthew 11:25–30 

SELF 

“For it is time for judgment to begin with God’s household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?” 1 Peter 4:17 

Beware all self-centered thoughts, choices, actions, and behavior, for these are surely evil. The exception is when we see our sin and present it to God for sanctification (Matt. 7:3–5). Our Father is calling us to be purged of all self-sourced preservation, protection, pity, pleasure, promotion, and even self-hatred or sabotage, as a part of the daily bread we receive from Him. When we pray for our will to be done instead of the Father’s, we’re making an evil choice. Every time we make ourselves our own source, that is selfishness working within us. This can result from a part of our heart that hasn’t been born again (splinters in our soul that need to be integrated) or from habits. We’ve been given the power and authority to see our hearts healed and habits undone. As we go forth in the commission of liberating creation, we must exhort others to do the same. 

“Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.” John 12:31

ADAM AND EVE 

“The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground— trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.” Genesis 2:9 

There were two trees in the Garden of Eden. The Tree of Life signified the choice of Love. It was God’s tree, where Adam and Eve received the offer of eternal, unconditional affection and support. God would be their source of everything. As long as they chose to eat from the Tree of Life and any other tree besides the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, all power and authority in creation would belong to Adam and Eve. God didn’t explain this to them in any great detail other than the fact that if they ate the fruit of the wrong tree, they’d certainly die. As a result, Adam and Eve lived in faith, trusting God as their source. 

“And the Lord God commanded the man, ‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.’” Genesis 2:16–17 

Eating from the Tree of Life wasn’t forced on them, as they could choose from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil at any time. The second tree represented the choice of not-Love and was the door to the realm of satan. Adam and Eve didn’t understand anything about this tree because, having not eaten its fruit, they didn’t have such knowledge. The realm of not-Love is self-focused, conditional, and, most importantly, temporal. Because of this, eating from that tree would hand all power and authority over to satan and would result in a process of death that reflected the temporal nature of not-Love. 

“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” Romans 6:23 

What Adam and Eve didn’t understand was that this “death” wasn’t an immediate end to existence but rather a decaying that led to death. Satan used this against them when lying to them, saying that if they ate from the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, they wouldn’t die. This distortion

Terraforming RESToration of the truth brought an accusation against God, essentially calling Him a liar. When Eve ate the fruit and didn’t immediately die, the accusation appeared correct, and Adam was drawn into the sins of accusation and disobedience. After they ate the fruit and all power and authority was handed to satan, the couple received knowledge that replaced their faith. They immediately realized what they’d done. Who told the truth, God or satan? God did. They learned this the hard way. 

“Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died.” Genesis 5:5 

God’s adult sons and daughters have been called to liberate creation from this very prison of decay. All creation (people, places, and things) has been “frustrated” by the choices Adam and Eve made, which we all inherited as their descendants (Romans 8:20–23). All around us is a continuing process of decay manifesting in the form of erosion, heartbreak, sickness, and death. For thousands of years, creation has waited, eagerly expecting us to be revealed and receive the commission, power, and authority of Christ (John 20:21–23). The fruit and fulfillment of this commission is when creation is set free from its bondage: 

“To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.” Revelation 2:7b

When we give up our self-life for His Life in us, we start down the path returning to the Tree of Life. Our Father always had a plan for our redemption far greater than we ever imagined! First, He sent His only begotten Son to fulfill the requirements of Love. Then, He waited for us to mature. The sign of this was when we did not love our lives so much as to shrink from death. Because we want Him more than we want ourselves, we’re becoming lovers like God. We’re responsible enough to receive power and authority back, in greater measure than before, through the power of the blood of the Lamb. We will restore creation to God through forgiveness and the declared testimony of what our Father has done.

Chapter Three 

Kings 

“For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on His shoulders.” Isaiah 9:6a 

The Lord is releasing Kingdom authority and power to His maturing children scattered throughout the earth. This is the prophesied generation who seek the face of God and His righteousness (Ps. 24:6). They are the ones Jesus longed for when He saw the unbelief of His day (Matt. 17:17).

The mature Church wants to be “perfect” (Matt. 19:21), so we do not love our lives so much as to shrink from death (Rev. 12:11). When this generation’s heart was revealed, it signaled the birth of the huios (G5207), the ‘adult son’ of Revelation 12:5 that represents the Church’s corporate adulthood. Now that we’ve matured, we can handle the responsibility of the authority and power the Lord is giving us. We are the royal government that sits on the shoulders of Jesus. 

“So Christ Himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers . . . until we all . . . become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants . . .” Ephesians 4:11,13a,c–14a

Because the Church has reached corporate adulthood, the functions of servanthood, speaking the Word of God on Earth, spreading the Gospel, shepherding, and teaching have been absorbed by the maturing sons and daughters of God, who are the royal government. For many centuries, the function of the Church has been to go out and bring in new converts who would stay for spiritual growth and fellowship. Now, we have a multi- functional, multi-faceted role in creation, where true Love will be represented clearly, acting as a magnet for the lost. New sons and daughters will be set free, delivered, and healed. They’ll be raised into maturity with great acceleration until they’re released to go forth in their calling. Gatherings of believers will no longer be lakes that dam water but rivers that flow out. Their works will affect all creation, completing what it’s been crying out for. Finally, the time has come!

“Creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.” Romans 8:19 (NIV 1984)

HISTORY

In August of my seventeenth year, my family went on a trip back to my birth state of Virginia. While there, my parents and I stayed at a friend’s house who was a prophetess at the Spirit- filled Presbyterian church we had previously attended. She was known for being a tested and accurate prophet who rarely gave words to individuals. Every day, during the four days we stayed at her house, she received words from the Lord for me, and one day, there were multiple words.

Decades later, in 2006, I looked for these words but couldn’t find any of them. Then, on September 28th, the prophetess contacted my mother to let her know she’d found one of the words in an old filing cabinet and then sent it by email. Shari and I were astonished at how accurate the word was; it literally described our lives at that time and hinted at my coming retirement from the bank (which we didn’t know about yet). The next day, she received and emailed a new word from the Lord for me. 

The message was short, mostly containing words of encouragement, but it opened with one simple, life-changing sentence, “Tell Scott Norvell that he is a man after My own

heart.” This rocked my spirit. From here, the Lord began to reveal King David to me in a personal way. I saw myself in him in so many aspects that it astounded me. When I read the books of Samuel and the Chronicles, they were alive and breathing! It wasn’t just history to me; it was a peek into my own life and heart. 

On May 22, 2007, the Lord took me to 2 Samuel 6:17, where King David also performed the duties of a priest. That day, the Lord told me, “You are a king like David was.” My spirit jumped. I knew this was true, but what on earth did that mean? I told Shari, whose eyes bugged out like Large Marge on a hoppin’ Thursday. She asked, “What on earth does that mean?” We didn't know. Literally minutes later, there was a knock on our door. A friend was there looking pale-faced. He said, “The Lord is speaking to me and—I don’t know. I feel like you’re Jonathan. It’s not a coincidence that you are a descendant of kings.” Whoa. Okay, so I’m a king, but what on earth does that mean!?! 

ROYALTY 

“With Your blood You purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation. You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.” Revelation 5:9b–10 (NIV 1984) 

There has been some contention with the word ‘kingdom’ in the translation of Revelation 5:10 from Greek. There is a text of the book that uses a different word, but the most reliable ones use the word basileus (G935), which means “one with authority to rule a kingdom” or “lord of the land.” In other words, a “king.” The song the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures sing declares that God’s children are made to be kings and priests to serve the Lord. This cross-references to what Peter said when he referred to us as a chosen generation, a royal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9). Isn’t it amazing that one definition of basileus is “lord of the land”? This is a restoration of the fullness of authority that the Lord gave to Adam (Gen. 1:26–28). It emphasizes our call to cleanse the land (Ezek. 39:14) and release its riches (Isa. 45:3) and storehouses (Job 38:22–23).

“If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.” Romans 11:17–18 

Who are these kings? They’re individuals purchased by Jesus from every tribe, language, people, and nation. We’re both Jew and Gentile. Together, we’ve been made holy by a new covenant (Jer. 31:31): the Jews, by birth through the original, everlasting covenants made to their forefathers, and the Gentiles, who were grafted into these covenants. The kings are people irrevocably called by God, paid for by Jesus, and filled with the Holy Spirit. They’re responding to God’s invitation with a resounding yes, no matter what it costs them. 

What do these kings look like? My favorite description is this: young, female, unemployed attorneys living in a van down by the river in Africa. We won’t fit into a stereotype. We’re humans, of both genders (male and female), of every color and size. We come from all classes (rich, poor, or middle), every kind of household (mansions, suburban homes, RVs, or huts), and in every nation. Church leaders in previous generations often held a place of honor and prestige. The kings may have a much different experience. There will be a lot more variety. While many leaders in the past experienced prestige, now sometimes they’ll be honored, and sometimes they won’t be. Some kings will be rich, and others will not. Some will be female, and some won’t. 

These kings are not rock stars. They’re not a handful of individuals everyone admires. We are a corporate Body of God’s sons and daughters. Much like a jigsaw puzzle, we form together to make a beautiful picture. Some may look at certain parts of the picture and say “that’s my favorite” because of what’s imprinted on them. However, the individual pieces, especially the ones being appreciated, shouldn’t become prideful because of their splendor. If removed from the complete picture, they lose their beauty because they’re out of context. Similarly, if eyeballs tell the rest of the body that they’re the most important feature, as they’re critical to seeing and beautiful to look at, they are

mistaken! Let’s face it: if you remove eyeballs and lay them on the table, they’re not as beautiful anymore; they can actually be quite disgusting! We were made to fit together! 

What will these kings do? This is where we have to start from scratch. Our understanding of the word “king” comes from history, where we see males dominating and subduing the free will of their subjects. It’s been a position of great financial wealth, military power, and personality fame in the natural world. They’re usually popular and viewed with great romanticism, and in some cases, envy by those around them. They wear nice clothes. They have fine jewelry. They live in castles with many rooms. They’re waited upon hand and foot by scores of staff. Don’t get your hopes up. This isn’t the type of king we’re called to be during our time on Earth. 

“The greatest among you will be your servant.” Matthew 23:11 

In the corporate adulthood of the Church, kings are toilet cleaners. Whenever I hear someone say, “Gosh, there just has to be a good, old-fashioned, well-used, utterly destroyed toilet around here that needs a thorough cleaning,” I think to myself, “They must be a king!” We are servants. We have been made humble by our God to love those around us. We care more about their eternity than our own short-term comfort or pleasure. We’re focused, willing, and able to do whatever the Lord calls us to so we can rescue our kidnapped family. We’re armed and dangerous for dismantling the works of the marauders terrorizing our Father’s Kingdom. 

While earthly kings subdue the free will of people, we are servants of mankind and rulers of creation. Creation has been groaning for us to be revealed because we have the authority to restore it to the Lord’s design. We can erase the memory of sins that cry out from creation (Gen. 4:10) when we fully forgive those who sinned, thus setting them free. We can release creation into its destiny of providing riches and storehouses to the Kingdom, while operating in spiritual unity with Heaven. When humans “bow” to us, it’s not an act of the body; it’s an act of the soul, a simple acknowledgement that the truth we’re speaking is coming from the Lord. They’re not bowing to our will but to God’s. There is a huge difference.

Are the kings and priests of the Church’s corporate adulthood some kind of elite class of Christian? No! They’re sons and daughters of God, filled with the Holy Spirit, given an irrevocable call from the Lord, who respond to His invitation with “yes.” We’re not afraid to take risks of faith and trust God with all our hearts (Matt. 25:25, Heb. 11:1, Prov. 3:5). We want what He’s offering us, even at the expense of our own lives. We’re even willing to face our detractors. Many theologians believe that the greatest persecution of God’s people comes from the world. It does not! As with Jesus, it comes from religion. We will respond with the power of love and forgiveness. We will dismantle the lies of the enemy and set our family free. 

“[The Lamb] is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with Him will be His called, chosen and faithful followers.” Revelation 17:14b 

God’s kingly sons and daughters do not hesitate to bow down before our Savior, the King of kings and Lord of lords, Yeshua Ha Mashiach, Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. No matter how far the Lord goes in honoring us (and He does so often), we remain His servants, friends, children, and very soon, His Bride. We remain His. He will reign forever and ever. The fact that the Lord has lifted us to a place of royalty is amazing enough. Our birthright and inheritance are beyond words. Nonetheless, we bow down to Jesus. We’re kings of this world, but He is our King and will be forever. 

Using Scripture to summarize: Kings are sons and daughters who are chosen by God (Deut. 17:15). We’re sanctified of all pagan, sinful practices such as materialism, greed, and sexual immorality (v. 16–18). We reply yes to the invitation and all God calls us to (verse 19). We’re humble servants of the people of the Lord (verse 20). As a result, we are fruitful and multiply, giving birth to others who become kings like us. Our descendants will cover the earth, bringing the love of our Father to all nations.

 KING AND PRIEST
 
  “Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, and he blessed Abram, saying, ‘Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth.’” Genesis 14:18–19 
  
  Melchizedek, king of Salem (Jerusalem), was a royal man of God renowned for honoring Abram (Abraham) after his defeat of Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him. Abram then honored Melchizedek with a tenth of everything recovered in the battle. Although this person is only given a brief mention (three verses), he’s considered an extremely important figure in the Bible. Melchizedek’s short story with Abram provides great historical insight, by revealing the existence of Salem around a millenia before King David, and lays a significant foundation for the coming Messiah.
  
   “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.” Psalm 110:4b 
   
   Melchizedek was both a king and a priest, but he was not of the tribe of Levi! In fact, he was alive many years before Levi was even born. Abram (Levi’s great-grandfather) was carrying the spiritual seed of Levi when he was blessed by Melchizedek (Heb. 7:10). This priest’s kingship serves as a model for us today. We are all called to be kings and priests, but many of us are not of the tribe of Levi by blood. We are, however, grafted into covenant with God through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, who is a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek. 
   
   “They brought the ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the Lord.” 2 Samuel 6:17 
   
   As mentioned before, David was another king who operated as a priest. After bringing the ark to Jerusalem, David is remembered for his exuberant worship (and notable lack of clothes). Also of great significance was that he personally sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the Lord. Yet David, unlike Melchizedek, was alive well after Levi’s time, and he was

 of the tribe of Judah! Only those belonging to the Levitical priesthood were permitted to perform these functions. Amazingly, David was allowed to present offerings because he was a king who heard his Father’s voice. Saul, of the tribe of Benjamin, did not hear his Father’s voice and, therefore, was disobedient when he made sacrificial offerings (1 Sam. 13:9). 
 
 “As the Father has sent Me, I am sending you.” John 20:21b 
 
 The Father sent Jesus to be a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. Now, Jesus has sent us to be His priests. We’re not above nor equal to Him, but we are kings and priests nonetheless. Like Jesus, we’re kings in the house of David. We’re of the root of Jesse, who entered into lasting covenant with the Lord Most High. Our royalty is founded in the Hebrew line of our Savior and in our intimate relationship with the Father. God has grafted us in so that through many daily portions of His will, we will gain His heart of love. 
 
 We walk in the greatest authority and power ever seen on Earth. What Adam had before the fall pales in comparison to what we’ve been offered. This gift comes from the redemptive power of the blood of the Lamb, and it’s been built upon by generational blessings coming from good choices our Church forefathers made. With each generation of the Church, the ceilings of the forefathers became the floors of the sons and daughters. This continued until we reached adulthood, when the Lord was able to release the authority and power of the “greater works” Jesus promised because we’re now mature and responsible enough to handle them (John 14:12). 
 
 There are many things we will do. Kings in the corporate adulthood of the Church will have the authority to interact with creation. We will hear what’s remembered in the earth and have the ability to respond by washing away sin or releasing storehouses. We have the authority to declare God’s Word on Earth and see His commands affect all creation. We will influence world leaders and events through direct and indirect choices and actions. We will post any angels the Lord assigns us and we will have authority to command demons. We will dismantle the kingdom of darkness when we forgive those whose sins established it, hurling down the accuser with the blood of

the Lamb and the word of their testimony. The scope of our authority is mind-boggling, so much, that to grasp it all, we’ll have to wait and see what the Lord reveals in each day’s bread. 

KEY 

Kings have both the authority to rule creation and the anointing to serve the children of God.

Chapter Four

Priests 

“Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work in the tent of meeting.” Numbers 4:3 

The royal priests are being called into service. All across the globe, God’s adult sons and daughters, filled with the Holy Spirit, are being put in place. These blessed, righteous people have been given great power and authority to fulfill all the functions of the priesthood in the end times. They were designed for this, with an irrevocable set of gifts and callings for such a time as this. They have accepted the invitation and do not love their lives so much as to shrink from death. They’ve been enlisted from every nation to receive the divine impartation and revelation of their identity as priests. 

“You and Aaron are to number by their divisions all the men in Israel twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army.” Numbers 1:3 (NIV 1984)

In Hebrew, ‘to serve’ is tsaba (H6633) and a form of it is mentioned in both Numbers 1:3 and 4:3. This word can also refer to a gathering of people organized for war or, in other words, an army. In Numbers 1:3, this makes perfect sense as Moses and Aaron are counting those in the army of the Lord. In Numbers 4:3, they are gathering priests. This leads us to the well-known Hebrew mindset that the priesthood is an army.

 “Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail, which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?” Job 38:22–23 
 
 This army of priests is God’s elite. They’re David’s mighty men. They have the highest skill sets in the Kingdom, given to them by the Lord. These irrevocable gifts caused them to stand out all of their lives. They have always seemed special. Some have been recognized for this while others have been outright rejected. Either way, these are God’s chosen warriors who will come together and work with the mightiest weapons ever seen, both in the spirit and the natural. 
 
 BACKGROUND 
 
 “You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between living creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.” Leviticus 11:47 
 
 In March of 2006, something strange happened. I got weird! Well, I started to get weird. It began when I heard the Lord say to me, “I don’t want you to eat pork, meat with blood in it, or shellfish anymore.” Good heavens! That was my diet! My favorite foods were “Daddy Patties,” which were bloody, “Scott” burgers cooked in bacon grease, and mudbugs (boiled crawfish). This was over a year before I quit my job to follow God, so I was still a rookie when it came to immediate obedience. Three days later, I received confirmation and realized it was time to change my eating habits. 
 
 “It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality.” Acts 15:28–29 
 
 Eating without my usual delicacies ended up being a little fun. The Lord replaced lobster and crabs with Chilean Sea Bass, a kosher cold-water fish that, when cooked right, has a very similar texture and taste. We really don’t miss pork much. Getting blood out of meat was also interesting. Having not been mentored by a rabbi, I had to rely on the Holy Spirit for

direction. For me, the easiest meat to kosher was ground beef, which I broke apart in a bath of warm salt water. Five minutes later or so (if already defrosted), the bath is deep red, and the meat is light grey with a touch of pink (protein juice). When cooking, I add plenty of kosher salt and some canola oil to replace the missing fats. Want some recipes?

“In the morning, O Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation.” Psalm 5:3 (NIV 1984) 

Then I got really weird. The Lord invited me to get up at 4:00 am each morning, seven days a week, with no alarm clock. Now, please understand that I have never been a morning person. In high school, I would get up on the weekends and during summer breaks at, oh, noon or so. Needless to say, it would take a miracle to get me up that early. When we said yes, however, the Lord’s grace was sufficient. He got us up each day at that time, and we prayed. What did we find? We found that our destiny appeared in our room each day like a treasure chest, fully opened and waiting for us at 4:00 am. By 6:00 am, it was gone. If we had slept in, we would have missed it. By not missing our time of visitation, we received all He had for us in that season. Nowadays, we get up whenever He gets us up, which, praise His holy name, is sometimes a little later. It’s also sometimes a little earlier. Whenever He calls us, we answer.

“Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.” Leviticus 19:27

The Lord began speaking to me about having a beard when I was a teenager living in Tulsa for the first time. I used to sit up in my room and see visions of myself traveling and speaking with a beard. Later on, I noticed it was a full one, with no shaping on the sides or neck. From 2001 to 2007, I had a kind of goatee that I never liked much, as I always looked angry in pictures, even when smiling. It turns out that the Philistines wore that type of beard as a war face. Eventually, when the Lord said to grow a beard, I knew exactly what kind.

“If a man or woman wants to make . . . a vow of separation to the Lord as a Nazirite . . . no razor may be used on his head. He must be holy until the period of his separation to the Lord is over; he must let the hair of his head grow long.” Numbers 6:2b,5b (NIV 1984)

In December 2006, I had an appointment to get my hair cut. The prior one was six weeks earlier when I almost had my head shaved. My hair was the shortest it had been since I was a baby! When the appointment came, the Lord clearly said, “Cancel it.” That might make sense to some, but to me, it came with no context. Two months went by, and I scheduled an appointment for February 2007. Once again, the Lord said, “Do not go.” A few weeks later, I was reading the book of Numbers, and the Lord showed me what a Nazirite vow was. He taught me about lifetime Nazirites, like Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist, and the Apostle Paul, who vowed for around a hundred days. 

As time passed and I quit my banking job, I waited for the end of the vow, which, from my research, would be around one hundred days. However, the Lord would not release me! In the ninth month, I had a high school reunion I felt the Lord wanted me to attend. Of course, I had long hair, a full-grown beard, and was unemployed! All my dreams of going to the reunion as a highly- paid executive were dashed. I looked like a homeless caveman! Yet, the Lord greatly provided. We had a marvelous time hanging with old friends, and not one person laughed at me! 

The Lord has blessed this beard. When it first grew in, I noticed the hairs were different in size, color, and texture. Near the cheeks were thin, blonde hairs like my Norwegian ancestors. Below those, extending from the sides to the mustache, were thick red hairs like my Scottish and Irish relatives. Below those are thick, straight brown hairs like those of eastern Europe. Further still come thick, straight black hairs then thick, black, curly ones! Nowadays, there are gray hairs all over the place! Each group of hair is growing in a different direction, like a map of cowlicks. I asked the Lord, “What does all this mean?” He responded, “The hairs represent the people of the earth I’m calling into My covenant. They are all going in different directions, but I will call them back into unity.” Amazing . . . but it all still seemed weird to me.

Starting in the summer of 2007, I began to receive words of knowledge about being a priest in the order of T’sadok. These were confirmed over and over again until March 2008, when a friend saw a vision of the Lord, who said, “Tell Scott Norvell he is a priest in the order of T’sadok,” and to “pay attention to 44.” She recommended I listen to a podcast where Neville Johnson had recently shared about T’sadok. In it, he mentioned the Lord gave him the word but had him hold onto it until the right day, which ended up being March 19, 2008. I was in shock because that was my birthday. The same day, the largest gamma-ray burst ever recorded was visible to the naked eye and announced by NASA. I was totally amazed. I guessed it was about time I found out who this T’sadok character was. 

T’SADOK 

“But the priests, who are Levites and descendants of Zadok [T’sadok] and who faithfully carried out the duties of My sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from Me, are to come near to minister before Me; they are to stand before Me to offer sacrifices of fat and blood, declares the Sovereign Lord. They alone are to enter My sanctuary; they alone are to come near My table to minister before Me and perform My service.” Ezekiel 44:15–16 (NIV 1984) 

When David became king over all of Israel, there were two main priests, Abiathar and T’sadok. Abiathar was of the house of Eli, the high priest whose Levitical lineage was shunned by the Lord after his sons defiled the temple with their sins. Abiathar was faithful to the house of David through the rebellion of Absalom and until the end of his service, where he faltered by siding with Adonijah over Solomon as David’s successor. Because of this, he and his family were stripped of their role as head priests and were forbidden to enter the Most Holy Place. 

“The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab’s position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok [T’sadok] the priest.” 1 Kings 2:35

T’sadok, on the hand, continually stood with the house of David and, along with Nathan the prophet, anointed Solomon as king. Because of this faithfulness, the Lord named T’sadok’s line as His priesthood forever. T’sadok was true to David’s house and had an intimate relationship with the Lord. He knew to support Solomon because that was who the Lord chose. He inquired of the Lord and knew His will. That is why the Lord put His trust in T’sadok and the priesthood of the millennial kingdom (the thousand-year reign of Christ) belongs to his line. 

“Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit?” 1 Corinthians 6:19a (NIV 1984) 

Today’s priests in the line of T’sadok have been given significant work for the end times. The Lord has given us the responsibilities of the Temple of the Lord, which is made of His children! We are maturing children who’ve given up our lives, so He can trust us with the lives of our brothers and sisters. There are many aspects to this which must be carefully addressed. The key is to know that Jesus needs us to love as He does. If we get that part right, we will be just fine. In the next few sections, we’ll continue looking at various functions of the royal priesthood. 

MINISTERING UNTO THE LORD 

“[David] appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord, to make petition, to give thanks, and to praise the Lord, the God of Israel.” 1 Chronicles 16:4 (NIV 1984) 

Our first line of work is directly with our Father. Priests are created for and called to stand in the Presence of the Lord, even when others cannot lift their heads from the ground. In this place of great intimacy, we listen to Him share His heart with us. We receive from Him the substance of everything else we do. Our role is to care about what He cares about—to want to see things from His perspective. We desire to know what He was thinking when He acted in the past (within earth-time) and in what He’s doing now. Priesthood is the closest, most personal, and intimate role in the Kingdom. It’s a place of great privilege. While all God’s children are called to intimacy with the Lord, only the priests who choose it will continue at this level for eternity.

When we were babies, we were very needy. Our parents needed to bring us everything and do it quickly. Even as we grew into adolescence, we continued to be self-focused in many ways. In the Church’s corporate adulthood, this must change. We absolutely have to change our focus from ourselves to Him in everything. When we pray, we pray His will to be done. When we petition, we first listen for what’s on His mind. When we praise and worship, we focus entirely on Him. This sounds obvious, but you’d be amazed at how often we can find ourselves distracted by self-interests. We must lay everything down and look full in His wonderful face! 

PURIFICATION 

“The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron’s descendants in the service of the temple of the Lord: to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms, the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the house of God.” 1 Chronicles 23:28 

Priests were called to purify the temple and make it clean. The former temple is a picture of the bodies of our brothers and sisters, and we are called to dismantle any evil strongholds the enemy has built in their lives.We do this by leading them through repentance and forgiveness, hurling down the accuser with the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. We also bring purification to places and things in creation by forgiving those whose sins brought authority and power to the enemy in the first place.

PRAISE AND THANKSGIVING 

“They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord.” 1 Chronicles 23:30a 

The Lord has done great things for us. He loves us so much! He wants to be near and dialogue with us. He is worthy of our thanksgiving. We should never take Him for granted. When the Lord reveals how He has intervened in our lives, blessed our works, or granted us grace or favor in a difficult situation, we’re invited and encouraged to give Him thanks. We get to tell Him directly how wonderful He is, how lost we are without Him, and

---
<p style="text-align:center;">

</p> 
{ #p53}

how much we appreciate His love for us! Our Father is all-powerful, all-seeing, and all-knowing. He does not have a set shape or form; He is eternal in all ways. This amazing, almighty God loves us more than we can comprehend. He is worthy of our thanksgiving. 

“Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; may Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.” Psalm 143:10 

In the corporate adolescence of the Church, we had worship leaders. These amazing men and women of God were anointed to praise the Lord with such fervor that others were compelled to follow. In many respects, worship was contagious through their joy, passion, and zeal. When people came to gatherings from the street and were impaired by the frustrations of the road, traffic, work issues, and the like, these leaders presented music that led us into His Presence, where our cares fell away. Usually, this worship music was determined in advance and rehearsed prior to the gathering. 

In adulthood, we have priests. These are God’s men and women who have given up their lives to see His will done. They prepare people, places, and things before worship gatherings by dismantling all power and authority of the evil one to interfere. All the sin within a place or the things involved will be erased when those who sinned are fully forgiven. Every person coming to worship will be forgiven. This priestly preparation strips evil of its rights to disrupt the Lord’s objectives in worship. 

“[The priests] were to play the lyres and harps, Asaph was to sound the cymbals, and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.” 1 Chronicles 16:5b–6 

While the act of worship can involve doing pretty much anything unto the Lord, the priests were instructed to lead gatherings with music. While the type of instruments used greatly impacts the atmosphere, the Lord is most interested in the heart of the people. The Father has set aside daily bread of His will for worship for those who gather in His name.

The priests are called to stand in His Presence and discern His will. The Lord enables them to receive instantaneous revelation that isn’t predetermined or rehearsed but comes during the actual time of worship. The Spirit of the Lord leads the priests in that atmosphere. On the musical side of things, this revelation determines what is sung, the notes to be played, and whether the tempo and dynamic should be upbeat and lifted for celebration or warfare; moderate before building into a crescendo; or slow and soft for soaking and entering into intimacy with the Lord. 

The toughest job for priests leading praise and worship is when they discern that the Lord wants to move in a certain way, but they receive instructions from Him to do something else first. It’s interesting to watch priests lead worship when those who were worship leaders in the Church’s adolescence are present. For example, the worship leaders may discern that the Spirit wants to be at a destination of celebration, but the priest won’t go there until the Lord says to. Why? The Lord knows when there are people in attendance who aren’t ready yet. In this case, the Lord will certainly leave the ninety-nine to try and save the one. Priests are patient and attentive to the messages coming from Heaven. We go wherever the Lord leads in the moment, even if it contradicts where our own spirit tells us we’re supposed to be headed. 

The Lord will have His people praise and worship, petition Him, and declare His will done. He also ministers to our hearts and has intimate time with His children when we do. He refills our wineskins, which run low when we pour out the Father’s love to our family and the lost. He encounters and speaks to our hearts with words of love, direction, and sometimes, gentle correction.

Our objective for worship should always be ministering to the Lord’s heart. Priests prefer to stand in the back where no one can see them. They’re often invisible worshippers who minister to the Lord whether anyone else joins in or not. We do not want to be on a stage. The focus of people worshipping should be on the Lord, not the priests. It’s about Him. This isn’t a spectator sport; it’s participatory. We are called to enter in.

 PROPHESYING 
 
 “David, together with the commanders of the army, set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun [priests] for the ministry of prophesying, accompanied by harps, lyres and cymbals.” 1 Chronicles 25:1a 
 
 David assigned the ministry of prophecy to the priests. While in the past, prophecy was provided by anyone with the gift, in adulthood, the Lord will reserve certain parts of His Word for only the priests to speak. Not only are the priests gifted for prophecy, but they’re anointed with fire after entering a deeper place of intimacy with the Lord; they responded yes to the invitation, though it cost them their lives. They’re the ones called to this service because the Lord has deemed them trustworthy. They will hear things no person has ever heard before and will speak them on the earth. 
 
 STOREHOUSES
 
  “Their fellow Levites [priests] were in charge of the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries for the dedicated things.” 1 Chronicles 26:20 
  
  The Lord stores treasures and riches in secret places (Isa. 45:3), which are storehouses for times of war (Job 38:23). These resources are under the stewardship of the priests. For example, in the US State of Colorado, we found a spiritual storehouse of discipline meant to bring the Lord’s people to fullness after integrating wounded and splintered parts of their souls. In Oklahoma, there is a treasure of worship. In Texas, we found great favor for innovation. These spiritual riches are like natural grains or fruit trees that grow native to a particular climate or region. The Lord places them in land by design as a sign of the fruitfulness of it. Before adulthood, the people of those lands prospered in what was stored there but faltered in other areas. Today, we’re privileged to share what God has placed in our region while receiving from others. This will better diversify the diet of spiritual things the Lord created for us all to prosper in.

 GATEKEEPERS
 
  “These were the gatekeepers belonging to the camp of the Levites [priests].” 1 Chronicles 9:18b 
  
  Regions with storehouses of treasures and riches are not meant to horde their wealth but to share. Just as Jerusalem and the former temple had gates, so do our lands. God designed storehouses to be available to trusted kings and priests, His maturing sons and daughters. The Lord has called His priests as gatekeepers. They are meant to regulate the spiritual intake and release of provision from their assigned regions. When gatekeepers are anointed, placed, and through intimacy with the Lord, taught their responsibilities, we will see a great revival of power and authority in the Church as they steward over those resources. These heavenly riches lead to fuller sanctification and, therefore, increased power, authority, and influence for seeing His will done. 
  
  JUDGES 
  
  “In any dispute, the priests are to serve as judges and decide it according to My ordinances. They are to keep My laws and My decrees for all My appointed feasts, and they are to keep My Sabbaths holy.” Ezekiel 44:24 
  
  Priests are anointed for settling disputes because they operate with great wisdom, hear the voice of the Lord, and are trusted by God to speak it. Heaven considers them a higher authority on Earth because they’re ministers unto the Lord, adult sons and daughters created to walk in wisdom. They hear the truth from the Lord and then share it with their brothers and sisters. 
  
  “Go to the priests, who are Levites, and to the judge who is in office at that time. Inquire of them and they will give you the verdict. You must act according to the decisions they give you at the place the Lord will choose. Be careful to do everything they direct you to do.” Deuteronomy 17:9–10 (NIV 1984) 
  
  Priests are anointed to enforce boundaries. When we reach maturity as individuals, we have a strong desire for righteousness and holiness. We know our source of these things is Christ but

 also that our behavior will change over time to look increasingly like Him. As we dismantle the enemy’s work in our lives and receive healing for our souls, the next step is to see our sinful habits overcome by setting and enforcing boundaries. Priests support their brothers and sisters as judges by bringing authority for their habits to be adjusted. In corporate adolescence, our authority figures came and dictated things to us. In adulthood, we freely choose to go to other priests and seek counsel, wisdom, and assistance in overcoming sinful behavior.
 
  TEACHERS 
  
  “For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, and from his mouth men should seek instruction—because he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty.” Malachi 2:7 (NIV 1984)
  
   The Lord assigned the ministry of teaching to Levi and the priests. As the Lord’s messengers, royal priests receive the greatest revelation of wisdom and knowledge in the Kingdom. They’re the ones our Father trusts to clearly represent Him on Earth among believers. This is an enormous responsibility! Just as kings inquire of the Lord for their choices, and face dire consequences when they fail to, royal priests must take this role very seriously. As an example, King David made a decision that lead to the death of 70,000 Israelites (1 Chron. 21, 2 Sam. 24). We do not want to lead His sheep astray.
   
   “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.” Matthew 5:17–20

Looking like the priests of the “Old” Testament (original covenants) isn’t on the minds of most Christians today. The focus has been on our righteousness coming from God by faith, which, of course, is true (Phil. 3:8–9). But, there is fruit we produce beyond the righteousness of our personhood, and it multiplies exponentially as we mature. As babies, we were called into the faith of Christ Jesus with little change to our cultural upbringing. Yet, as adults, we must look at how the Lord originally instructed His people. Then, we can understand who we are and where we come from. The greater works Jesus promised us lie in the greater revelation of our history. The ceiling of the original Jews became the floor of every person who embraced their destiny in Christ. To understand the fullness of who we are, we must embrace it: we’re both Jew and Gentile, one new man created from the history of the original, everlasting covenants and the new covenant that grafts us into the original. 

“But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.” 1 Peter 2:9 (NIV 1984) 

KEY 

Priests are ministers unto the Lord and His Temple, which is the children of God.

Chapter Five

Fathers and Mothers

“Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.” 1 Corinthians 4:15 (NIV 1984) 

“Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too.” Romans 16:13 

We were all born of moms and dads in the natural, who may have also raised us into adulthood. Parents and guardians impart culture and belief systems to their children. They teach them to discern between what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior, both at home and abroad. They draw boundaries and bring loving correction and discipline when boundaries are crossed. They nurture their children, encouraging the development of confidence and stability for becoming all God created them to be. One day, they release them as adults into the fullness of their calling. And, clearly, parents never make mistakes! Well, that would all be true in a perfect world, anyway. 

“The Lord, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the spirit of man within him . . . ” Zechariah 12:1b (NIV 1984)

The Lord created His sons and daughters to have both natural and spiritual parents, and He predestines who they will be. One challenge in that process is that humans have free will. Our choices greatly affect if we have children and who with. 

God is amazing! He gave our being a design (Gen. 1:28) and created our soul out of the dust of the earth and His breath (Gen. 2:7). Yet, humans (adam) aren’t only body (basar) and soul (nephesh) but also spirit (ruach). The Father formed our spirits within Himself at the foundation of the earth. It was then that He predestined who our spiritual parents would be. No matter what poor choices we make in life, God can redeem them through the blood of the Lamb and His design of us. For that purpose, spiritual parents are the people God has intended to help nurture us into adulthood. They help us mature, and then, it’s our turn to do the same for others! 

SPIRITUAL WOMBS 

“In reply Jesus declared, ‘I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. How can a man be born when he is old?’ Nicodemus asked. ‘Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb to be born!’ Jesus answered, ‘I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.’” John 3:3–6 

God intends spiritual parents to enter our lives by establishing a safe environment of Love where we can mature. The enemy knows that the Lord has sown seeds of life in each of our hearts (Matt. 13). As such, our development into adulthood is a grave threat to him and the kingdom of darkness. The evil one conspires with great focus to cause us to stumble and fall, get others to trip us up, or to take us out completely. 

Spiritual parents have been given the irrevocable call to nurture their children into adulthood as individuals. Before children are drawn to them for caregiving, these parents must say yes to this call and not reject it. It will cost them every plan for their lives that is outside of the Father’s will. They must yield to Him and undergo a significant sanctification and healing process so they can parent without polluting their children.

Like kings and priests, they are deeply trusted by the Lord. As they demonstrate their trustworthiness, He will impart to them expansive authority and power to establish a spiritual womb with great safety. Wombs are both people and places (land) that have the irrevocable gift and call of birthing new wine or new wine skins. Spiritual parents will have charge over His angels for developing Kingdom strongholds on Earth where these children will be able to grow up and give birth to their spiritual identity and destiny. 

HEALING 

“Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.” James 5:16 

Parents establish a home for their children so they can be kept in continual wellness. Because most spiritual children are being reconciled to their spiritual parents later in life, much healing is usually needed. In the Church’s corporate adulthood, spiritual parents are the Light of the world shining to reveal hidden sins the evil one is using against their children (Matt. 5:14). These sins are valid accusations that bring great power and authority to satan. 

Spiritual parents have the authority to dismantle the enemy’s power in daily bread portions by forgiving the person(s) who sinned and hurling down the accuser with Lamb’s blood and the word of their testimony. Over time, their child is set free from oppression, delivered of torment, and healed of any manifestation of that influence. The enemy’s deception that empowered temptation is swept away, enabling a person to see clearly and fully choose Love without a distortion. 

DISCIPLINE 

“I will be his father, and he will be My son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with the rod of men, with floggings inflicted by men.” 2 Samuel 7:14 (NIV 1984)

In the Church’s corporate adulthood, the Lord has ordained spiritual parents to be representatives on Earth to bring discipline to His children in the house of David. Children need to understand what the Lord expects of them; however, the child’s revelation of this comes directly from the Lord through their personal relationship with Him. Spiritual parents are not “Samuels” that the children depend on as a replacement for hearing God; they’re representatives that support the Lord by being an earthly presence. 

Once children understand what the Lord desires of them and are set free from the evil one’s power, which keeps them from meeting those expectations, they’re ready to learn the behaviors they’ll need. Parents guide them through the trial of fire. They teach the child righteousness and responsibility to choose what the Lord is inviting them to. Parents reveal that our choices need to be given to the Lord as an offering. It’s important that children understand that choice is a foundation of Love, and when the Lord has a willing son or daughter that yields to Him, He can and will do anything! 

Spiritual offspring may not be spiritually mature, but they are usually adults over seventeen years old. That means they are accountable for their own actions. Because of this, spiritual parents must reinforce the revelation of the Spirit to them: they are responsible for their choices and will be judged according to those by Jesus Himself one day (Matt. 25:31–46). Through the complete work of the revelation of the Spirit and the support of spiritual parents, children can grow with a hunger for holiness and a near desperation for righteousness. 

True spiritual parent-child relationships come from the Lord. The invitation God gives you to any specific relationship is completely voluntary, and therefore, safe. Acceptance is a daily walk. Spiritual children can opt out of this relationship at any time and reject the Lord’s calling to it. But would you do that? This could sound like a threat, but it truly isn’t. These relationships depend on spiritual parents being healed of sins of anger, domination, and control, while the children need to be healed of fear, distrust, and the urge to flee for their lives. The Lord has called us to lay down everything to be free but also to

walk in our destiny. He is bringing us to a place where we’re willing to receive His relationships for us, no matter the cost. We won’t love our lives so much as to shrink from death. It is well worth it! 

FRUIT 

“Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.” Matthew 7:19–20 

In John 3:16, Jesus told us that whoever has pistis (G4102), or ‘faith,’ to believe that Jesus will save us will have eternal life. Jesus also spoke of a greater reward within eternal life called the “Kingdom of Heaven” (James 2:14–26). He outlines a need for fruitfulness in order to enter this Kingdom. 

Outside this Kingdom is a place that isn’t the burning lake of sulfur (Rev. 21:8) but is called “outer darkness.” In this place are the servants of the Lord who are afraid to take risks that produce fruit (Matt. 25:30), those who don’t pursue the will of the Father (Matt. 7:21), those who come to the wedding without the proper garments (Matt. 22:13), and the huioi (children) of the Kingdom who don’t have pistis (faith, Matt. 8:10–12). 

Inside the Kingdom of Heaven are the Father’s children who did His will and produced great fruit (Matt. 5:1–12)! Conversely, the lake of burning sulfur is reserved for the huioi of diabolos, or the adult children of the devil, who will be revealed at the end of the age (Matt. 13:38–42). These people do not have faith and will be identified by their fruit; they are “the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters, and all liars” (Rev. 21:8). 

Those intended by the devil to be his children are born as it was in the days of Noah (Matt. 24:37–38), when angels married the daughters of men and bore children to them (Gen. 6:1–4). In Terraforming for the Kingdom, we identified this pollution of DNA through generational sins of witchcraft and incest. This perversion must be restored to God’s design, something that can only be done through the fullness of forgiveness, with the blood of the Lamb and the word of the affected’s testimony.

INHERITANCE 

“The seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people.” Zechariah 8:12 

Spiritual parents are called to demonstrate the Inheritance Covenant to the Lord’s children. Without any effort on their part, they pass on their spiritual DNA to these children. The Lord combines this with blessings in the natural to make the melting pot of the child’s destiny. He’s promised that the remnant who yield to Him and inquire for daily bread of His will done will bear fruit. When we subject our will to His, trusting in Him with all our heart, leaning not on our own understanding, He imparts the fullness of our gifts and calling and releases us into destiny. 

“I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments.” Deuteronomy 5:9b–10 (NIV 1984) 

Spiritual parents have an inheritance of their own when they yield to the Lord and receive their daily bread portions of His will. They become parents of love who invest in their own heavenly treasures when they pour into their spiritual children. They don’t succumb to jealousy or envy at the notion of their children exceeding their deeds. By honoring their children and creating a high ceiling that will become their children’s floor, spiritual parents build a landscape for their own inheritance. They make way for a thousand generations of grandchildren who will carry on their spiritual DNA, even if they don’t look like the patriarch or matriarch. This is an eternal blessing of the Lord for every parent who says yes to the call and lays down their life.

Chapter Six 

Helen Keller 

“Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.” Isaiah 35:5–6 (NIV 1984) 

When I think of our spiritual gifts, I often think of Helen Keller. Here was this amazing little girl, born in a time (1880) when there were few solutions for her condition of both deafness and blindness. We can only imagine what it was like for her in the first seven years of her life before realizing the strange movements she felt in one hand correlated to the water she felt in her other hand. Before Anne Sullivan gave her language, she had to invent ways to communicate with her family. This was awkward for the Keller family as none of them shared her condition and couldn’t fully empathize. There were no other deaf-blind persons in their region of Alabama to use as role models. 

Helen needed instruction as all children do, but she needed help that was unique. She had three working senses: touch, taste, and smell. She also had several methods of expression, some constructive—and some not. Helen could express herself through body movement, vocal sounds (that she couldn’t hear), and touch. She needed someone special who could understand what

she was going through and was created to help people in her condition. They had to go to the other side of the country (Boston) to find Anne, who was the right person for the job.

We all live in a natural world, where we’re taught to process what we see and hear. Yet, every human alive was born with irrevocable, spiritual gifts they don’t fully understand how to use; these endowments haven’t been developed, but the Lord has a plan. He prepared a strategy for the day when the Church was old enough to handle bigger responsibilities. For these days, when we do not love our lives so much as to shrink from death, He calls some to be fathers and mothers. These spiritual parents will minister to God’s sons and daughters in a spiritual womb, a safe and loving environment that aids growth. There, the children will learn to operate in the fullness of their irrevocable gifts. As a result, spiritual eyes will be open, spiritual ears will be unstopped, the lame will leap, and the mute tongue will shout for joy! 

NURTURING 

“Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.” Psalm 144:12 (NIV 1984) 

Spiritual parents feed, train, and teach their children. This process has two different approaches: one for those who are spiritually young and another for children who’ve been walking in the spirit for some time. The spiritually younger children will start fresh with the wineskin and resources of the Church’s corporate adulthood. They’ll learn to operate in their gifts in unity with their brothers and sisters. They’ll get to apply their gifts in the context of their calling. One person will be the hand, while a sibling will be the arm. Another will be the torso, and another still, the legs. As the whole Body, they will learn to operate together and bear much fruit for the Kingdom of God. 

Those who are spiritually “older” when they start this process will have more challenges—all of which can be overcome! They must first remove their old wineskins and freely release them. This doesn’t mean despising the past but rather blessing and honoring it. Children of God must understand the Lord’s purpose

for new wine to know that the old must eventually go. It can be difficult to release past processes that produced some fruit and brought credibility to many Church ministers. It’s critical for each person to be willing to set aside their former knowledge of how to operate and be willing to receive new keys from the Lord.

Old habits are hard to break, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible! Spiritually older children must be willing to submit to what is new. This means humbling ourselves. The teachers must become teachable again. The seniors in high school have graduated only to become freshmen! Can spiritually older children handle this? Are we able to let go of what we knew and receive this transition? Are we willing to be taught new tricks? What if that means learning from scratch and having to form new patterns of behavior? Do we still say yes to God? 

“Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.” Ephesians 6:4 (NIV 1984)

Like Helen Keller, the children of God need anointed instruction. Before Helen met Anne Sullivan, she was dangerous! She was able to walk, yes, but without assistance, she was a threat to herself, others, and the family chinaware! She couldn't see the path in front of her or hear warnings of impending doom. She needed urgent care from a patient, kind, loving servant who wanted the best for her. 

Fathers and mothers are called to become the servants of their children. They live a selfless life of building up those who will replace them. They’re made to humbly prepare the next spiritual generation, praying fervently that these kids will exceed their past exploits. They work hard, understanding that there may be nothing in it for them. Instead of jealousy, they desire to give more so the world can benefit from their children’s fruit. They look forward to the day when they get to release their children to raise some of their own!

GIFTS

“If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!” Matthew 7:11 (NIV 1984) The Father has granted His children senses for operating in the spiritual realm. We can liken revelation to hearing (wisdom, knowledge, prophecy) and discernment to seeing (identifying right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, spirit vs. flesh, Love vs. not- Love). Kingdom children need to be instructed on using these gifts, which are invisible to the five natural senses (sight, sound, taste, smell, and touch). Once a child realizes how these manifest and how they affect our lives every day, a lot will finally begin to make sense!

“It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings.” Proverbs 25:2 (NIV 1984) 

It is a royal function to receive revelation from the Lord. Our Father intends for us to operate with an understanding of things unseen. He wants us to know more about Him so we can know more about ourselves. The Lord ordains His servants to receive this revelation. He pours it out to us, irrevocably, whether we walk entirely in His ways or not. He has a great purpose for this gift to bring about His will and our destiny on Earth. Yet many don’t realize this because the gift of revelation isn’t tangible to their physical senses. 

When I was working for a bank, I received revelation from the Lord all the time. Quite frankly, in that season, I had no idea it was the Lord or that it had Kingdom purposes. God showed me many things concerning business that no one understood until I explained it to them. This was coming from the guy who failed freshman algebra in high school! When the Lord began using that gift in my life to heal people, it all came together. I realized that He gave me a gift to receive His big picture so I could learn ways to transform creation. This is His design for all of His sons and daughters. It only takes a few of us to change the world!

“You [priests] must distinguish between the unclean and the clean.” Leviticus 11:47a (NIV 1984) 

It is the priests’ job to function with discernment. Priests are judges and teachers able to receive different kinds of spiritual input and determine which parts are good and which are pollution. This discernment can come through experiencing the memory of sin within land or even seeing demons with their natural eyes. Some people can hear someone speak and discern that their words are polluted. When a young child grows up with this gift but without instruction, they can learn some bad habits. Can you imagine what it’s like for a child to hear a demon speaking through a person’s words or see it on their face? 

Priests need extensive instruction in the gift of discernment. Many operate in it, not knowing it’s a spiritual gift. That dynamic can be a playground for demonic tag teams. In other words, demons want to set people up to offend each other. A good example is when a discerning person can tell that what someone is saying is tainted by evil, which may agitate the discerner. They might “hear” things in the spirit that aren’t spoken out loud but are coming from the influence of demons. Handled poorly, a discerning person aware of that influence may accuse someone of saying or doing something they didn’t. This can and has caused offense in much of the Body of Christ. 

Over a decade ago, Shari and I had loads of fun learning about discernment. Whenever I befriended someone whose sin was a threat to my well-being, she would discern it. However, back in those days, neither of us realized that this was a spiritual gift. Shari would have extreme emotional responses to my interactions with these people. I would get very angry at Shari, thinking her concerns were totally irrational. 

I had a group of friends who, like me, were all addicts of some sort or another: one to alcohol, one to pot, me to tobacco, etc. Whenever we met up, we would fall off the wagon together. Guy one would drink, guy two would take a hit, and Scott would have a cigarette. Each of us had other friends who would participate, turning the get-together into a mob. It should be noted that with every mob, there’s a demonic ringleader. These demons bring power to the addictions that cause people to fall. Shari would

discern this and get very upset whenever I mentioned one of these friends. For a long time, that really frustrated me because I was choosing to ignore the log in my eye—that these friendships resulted in sin—and pointed at the lack of evidence in Shari’s warning. 

This is one of the greatest lessons God’s children can learn before stumbling into an argument. Many people look at life pragmatically. They only recognize what people say or don’t. They primarily look at the facts as recorded by the five senses and operate on the natural level of life. At the same time, many look at life through their spirits. (That is a compliment!) Because of this, they discern things that cannot be seen, heard, smelled, tasted, or felt. Factual people can get especially frustrated if arguing with discerners over something they discerned and described as if it happened in the natural. Fact-focused people may think those discerners are crazy! 

It’s crucial we realize that discerners were created by God to recognize Truth from deception, good from evil, and Love from not-Love. It’s the responsibility of factual folks to realize that God created people to discern and learn to trust that. It’s the discerners’ responsibility to learn to recognize when they are discerning; that way, they can express their gift with clear words more than emotion. I recommend starting with the following: “Hey, I’m discerning something . . . ” 

Some of these scenarios would be funny, except in our travels, we’ve found instances where discerners were accused of being literally insane. There were gifted women of God who were locked up in asylums because they were discerning things that were actually happening, but they didn’t have proof. Some men, tired of interference with their attempts to sin in the dark, had these sweet women forcibly removed from their lives. They had no idea what they were missing! The Lord’s design for women like these was to warn the Church of impending doom. If men had listened, the Church would have grown up centuries ago. 

Until a discerning person learns to operate with this gift (instead of against it), they are targets of demonic division. The Lord has called fathers and mothers to mentor these priests into the fullness of their calling as they learn to respond to discernment

with love. Priests are called to receive discernment and then look to the Lord for instructions. Should we forgive someone? Should we confront the person who spoke by presenting the truth? Should we say nothing and pray later? We don’t know until we’ve asked the Lord to show us in the Light of His Presence. 

What about those who don’t know Jesus as Savior? Can you imagine having discernment and not knowing the Lord? At first, there’s no context for what’s being experienced, no language to describe it, and possibly no mentors to learn from. Is it any wonder that so many people with strong prophetic gifts end up in witchcraft? The spirit of religion has kept supernatural manifestations away from Christ’s followers for almost two thousand years. Yet practitioners of witchcraft have welcomed them with open arms! Every human on Earth was created with irrevocable gifts to be used in their unique, irrevocable calling from God. Each one needs mentoring from experienced, trustworthy fathers and mothers.

“And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and He is in heaven.” Matthew 23:9 (NIV 1984) 

In Matthew 23, when Jesus said that our Father in Heaven was our only father, He was, of course, not indicating that female virgins would conceive us all; He definitely knew we would have two biological parents. He was simply addressing the title of “Father” as being reserved for God. This also wasn’t a prohibition on how we address our spiritual parents. Whether or not you refer to someone as “Dad,” “Mom,” “Pa,” or “Popsicle” doesn’t matter compared to the importance of the Lord’s call for spiritual parents to lead us into adulthood. All sons and daughters need training to master their calling. It’s a critical step in maturing and reaching the fullness of Christ. 

KEY 

Spiritual parents are called to mentor the sons and daughters God sends to them for training. From that relationship, maturing children use and understand their irrevocable gifts and release the fullness of their calling.

Chapter Seven 

Driver’s Education 

“I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” Matthew 16:19

It’s a new season in the Church, and many prophecies are being fulfilled! A very important one for us is Jesus’ promise that, at a certain point, He would give us the Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven. Another was Paul’s prophecy that creation is groaning for the coming revelation of the sons and daughters of God. 

You wouldn’t give the keys to a high-powered Ferrari to a six- year-old son or daughter. They could hurt themselves or others! You wouldn’t give the keys to a sixteen-year-old, either. They could hurt the Ferrari! No, you would only hand the keys to an adult. Revelation 12 shows us that at the birth of the adult Church, we become mature enough to handle the responsibility of the Keys. We have entered a season where we do not love our lives so much as to shrink from death! We’re finally able to drive “the Ferrari.” 

“Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.” Psalm 144:1

Before we can rev engine and pop gear, we must be fully trained in how to drive the Ferrari. Almost every Christian has a foundation of doctrines that have been tainted by the demon of religion. We inherited this contaminant from governmental leaders who intermingled Jesus with pagan traditions (Constantine, Helena, and Theodosius). These misaligned foundations must be quickly exposed, dug up, and replaced with the truth of Christ. 

Practical instruction for driving the Ferrari begins by removing religion from our hearts and all old wine from our new wineskin. The Lord has shown us that mixing old wine with a new wineskin will cause what is like toxic algae to grow in the pools of our hearts. To receive new wine, we must be willing to lay down all old ways of thinking, no matter how fruitful they were in a prior season. This can be a challenge for those who’ve received accolades for their mastery of the old wine. Yet those who humble themselves before the Lord will be lifted up! God has a plan. You don’t want to miss it! 

A HEARING EPIDEMIC 

“After the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.” 1 Kings 19:12 

Before you can get a driver’s license, you must submit to an eye exam. The hidden secret of many in the Church today is that they can’t see the signs of Heaven and they don’t hear their Father’s voice. Historically, this distinction became more prevalent in the mid-1990s, when the Lord poured out the Spirit in a way that brought a tangible experience to many people’s relationship with God. Countless people witnessed genuine encounters others were having with God that they didn’t experience themselves. There were two reactions from some of those who felt they “missed out”: If it wounded their pride, the first reaction was anger. This resulted in many church splits. The second reaction came from a wound of fear that God had somehow abandoned or rejected them. Many of those people went into a kind of hiding. 

The Church is in two camps: those who can hear and those who cannot. Some within the non-hearing camp don’t realize that they actually are hearing. Conversely, among the hearing camp

are those who aren’t hearing but pretend to. Pretending to hear the Father’s voice is one of several dangerous paths leading to the house of Saul (who required Samuel to hear God). Finally, some people who aren’t hearing have an irrevocable gift of authority and use that to proclaim selfish desires, which is by definition, not Love. That dynamic can lead to a generation of God’s children at risk of being led astray. 

“You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about Me, yet you refuse to come to Me to have life.” John 5:39–40 (NIV 1984) 

When you can’t hear your Father’s voice, you may become dependent on the Bible as your source instead of speaking directly to Him. The Bible is meant to confirm and testify to what the Lord tells us individually. You can’t fully inquire of the Lord if you can’t hear Him answer you. You can only petition Him and hope for the best. Fortunately, the Lord wants us all healed so we can unify and pursue daily portions of our Father’s will done. This is how Love will prevail in creation! 

The biggest reason people can’t hear their Father’s voice is because their parents didn’t bond with them emotionally (especially their dad), and their soul has a wound we often call the Loner splinter (S5). The door from our spirit in Heaven to our soul on Earth becomes blocked or shut (Eph. 2:6). This wounded place in us needs to be integrated and opened so we can receive what the Father is giving us in Heaven. Additionally, we need basic instruction on how to hear our Father’s voice. 

When we first started in prayer ministry for people, I was only able to hear the Father’s voice at home. However, at that time, we had sixty minutes to pray for a person’s healing! That is a long time to only be asking the Lord to heal and then declaring Isaiah 53:5 over a person! Eventually, we had to get fresh manna from Heaven! We need to receive each jigsaw puzzle piece of daily bread to see the complete picture of our Father’s will for Love!

As we’ve shared before, we learn to hear by being willing to take risks. When I first started listening to the Lord, I would clear my mind and make room for a thought to appear. When one did, I chose to immediately (with some trepidation) speak it out for confirmation. When I took this risk, there was fruit! I began to learn how God uses our thoughts, visions, memories, and perceptions to communicate with us! Soon thereafter, we discovered how even road signs, clock times, or even cloud formations could be communication from Heaven! Don’t put a limit on how God speaks. He will use anything and everything. Just remember, the Lord always has a purpose. While we’re maturing, He’ll speak to us in childlike ways, but then He wants to get down to business. We have family to rescue!!! 

“There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit . . . The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ.” 1 Corinthians 12:4a,12 (NIV 1984) 

Avoid comparing your gifts to that of your brothers or sisters. The enemy would have you either (a) feel inadequate because your gift doesn’t seem as amazing, often and especially compared to those who vividly see in the spirit, or (b) have you feel pride if your gift seems to have significant value. 

The key to mastering a gift is having a way to apply it. For this, we must be willing to lay down our lives and receive God’s plan for us. Everyone has an opportunity to minister, and in that posture of servanthood, royal priests arise and take their place! 

HIGH-OCTANE FUEL 

“Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.” Matthew 9:17 (NIV 1984) 

The Kingdom’s Ferrari has a high-performance engine that requires high-octane fuel. You absolutely cannot put old wine in this new wineskin. However, there is grace, and the Lord will take us through the process of releasing old wine. His school of driver’s education is a season where we transition to the new. It’s

critical for us to receive the impartation of maturity so we can start thinking like God’s adult children. Instead of waiting for every meal to be brought to our table, we must know how to reach into the fridge, get the ingredients, and make our own! 

The new wine of adulthood is a high-octane fuel that gives our engine better horsepower. We’re going to need it! There are crucial revelations that the Lord gave the Church hundreds, even thousands, of years ago. In the last century, the unveiling of that deposit of revelation accelerated exponentially to where what once took ten years to comprehend suddenly only took one. Then, what used to take one year to grasp only took a month. Now, these same breakthroughs may take less than ten minutes for a person to receive. The Lord is giving us revelation in a single sentence that once took an entire class to teach. 

We’re getting the impression that the time is short (1 Cor. 7:29). We must be able to receive this impartation into our spirits and go forward pursuing daily bread. As the Lord waters these seeds, they will produce fruit. We must learn driving techniques from the Spirit. Each of us is unique in this fashion. We will receive guidance directly from the Lord when we listen, hear, and act!

HEART AND MOTIVES 

“But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.” Matthew 7:14 

A Ferrari is not meant for off-road driving. In this analogy, the road is our Father’s will, and going off road represents our will. Adult sons and daughters of God know to pursue their daily bread portions of our Father’s will done. We yield to Him because He has the plan of Love for us. God is everywhere (Ps. 139:7–8), all-powerful (Luke 1:37), and all-knowing (Heb. 4:13). He will establish Love for eternity. Why on earth would we ever want to bypass Him and do it our way? 

“For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.” Matthew 12:50

Now that we can see the road by hearing our Father’s voice, we must stay on it! We simply cannot use the power and authority of the Keys of the Kingdom for our will done. We cannot say, “I’ll do it my way and then redeem the situation with Jesus’ blood and my testimony.” That is a massive misuse of the responsibilities we’ve been given. In banking, we called that “not used for purposes intended.” That phrase was the endorsement on the back of a cashier’s check when you needed to turn it in for a refund. We don’t want our Father to take the Keys back from us due to misuse! Additionally, if we take the Keys and use them with tools that are tainted by selfishness or aren’t the Father’s will, we’re driving the Ferrari off-road. Don’t do this. 

“A wife of noble character is her husband’s crown, but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.” Proverbs 12:4 

Our character corresponds directly to how we drive. If we go for joy rides in the Ferrari, we can lose concentration and skid off road. That’s not to say we’re not allowed to have fun while driving; we can and do! But it’s important our choices reflect our motives. Do we realize the responsibility we’ve been given? Are we focused on the mission at hand? Don’t allow the evil one to lull you into sleeping at the wheel! Don’t lose sight of what you’re driving and have been commissioned with. We have a privilege many people in every generation would’ve given up their lives for so that their generation could do what we get to! 

“The Levites are to be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the Testimony.” Numbers 1:53b (NIV 1984) 

To continue our analogy, do not send or read text messages on your smartphone while driving a Ferrari. Distractions are a ploy of the evil one to get you to veer from the path or miss an important turn. It’s very easy for a driver to get too comfortable in the seat and lose respect for the horsepower under the hood. We’re not dealing with a four-cylinder, two-door, putt-putt mobile. The Lord released the Keys because we’re responsible. We must live up to this by yielding our lives to His will.

ACCOUNTABILITY 

We have turned down a one-way street. For most of us, this is good news. There really is no going back. The Lord has called us to a life of dying to ourselves so we can become the sons and daughters of Love we were created to be. To this end, the process of sanctification that used to occur on an as-needed basis has now become a lifestyle. The shift isn’t because we’re self- absorbed but because God has made it so easy. It’s a simple but critical portion of our daily bread. 

“Yet, O Lord, You are our Father. We are the clay, You are the potter; we are all the work of Your hand.” Isaiah 64:8 (NIV 1984) 

When we integrate a wounded, splintered part of our soul, it’s like having the Potter add a lump of clay to an already formed pot. The vessel was already shaped and decorated but was smaller than intended. As we integrate, He adds those designed portions back onto the pot. At first, it may look a little funny, being ornate and beautiful with a big lump of unformed clay sticking out of the side, but that lump will be melded in. The Potter will do this with pressure and heat. This may not be popular (before or when it happens), but it is good! The end result is that the pot will be that much closer to the scope and beauty the Potter intended. Thankfully, the Lord doesn’t mind reforming us over and over again. It’s His joy! 

“But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.” Jeremiah 18:4 

The heat and pressure needed to return and meld a “lump of clay” into our being comes from accountability and discipline (James 5:16, Heb. 12:5). Each of us must be willing to stand in the Light with a brother or sister in the Lord and stay accountable for our choices. This is the Father’s process for molding us; in other words, we’re replacing habits that aren’t Love with new or relearned behaviors of Love. The Lord will highlight a behavior to us, what wound triggers it, how the wound occurred, and whose sin caused it. Then, we integrate the splinter by washing it in the blood of Jesus, repenting, and

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p> 
{ #p83}


---

forgiving all those responsible for the wound. This will dismantle any demonic stronghold in our life. From there, we must hold ourselves accountable to choose Love in the future so we overcome old habits. 

The process of accountability and discipline is critical while learning and continuously improving our Ferrari driving skills. We will need these skills in the very near future. For that purpose, we must become vulnerable to our accountability partner(s) when we confess our sins. This might sound obvious or even easy, but the part of your soul being healed can be very self-focused and self-protective. This can result in additional habits of hiding sin, lying, or defending yourself by not taking responsibility for your actions and choices. These are direct impediments to healing soul wounds. 

Equally, the Lord has given us justice as a privilege of being sons and daughters. Justice is different from judgment. Judgment is a final decision about who we truly are, and the consequence is relative to our choices. On the other hand, justice is the natural side-effect of every choice we make: if we choose Love, we can expect benefits; if we choose not-Love, we can expect detriment. 

If we sin, we can participate in accountability as adult sons and daughters by inquiring of the Lord to prescribe a consequence in our lives. This consequence takes the place of any normally occurring detriment (decay) that would come from a selfish, not-Love choice. The Lord honors our submission to the consequences of discipline. Through it, He even allows creation itself to evade the frustration and harm that would have come from our selfish choice. 

“Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in His holiness. No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.” Hebrews 12:10–11 (NIV 1984) 

Discipline is God’s mercy, a short-term correction to avoid permanent judgment. All Ferrari drivers are sons and daughters who have submitted themselves to God’s discipline. This is how

<p style="text-align:center;">
- 84 -

</p> 
{ #p84}


---

we grew responsible enough to drive in the first place! If we make the adult decision to confess our sins, we will stay in the Light and out of the darkness. If we struggle with making good choices, our next option is to assign a consequence to our actions. Loss of privilege is a very effective consequence for most people, but in certain harmful situations, more drastic measures may be needed, such as a loss of access. The key is to be provided and choose a consequence that encourages future choices of Love. 

There is no autopilot! In the end, we must all make our own choices. No person in your life—a spouse, sibling, parent, friend, pastor, or even boss—can take you past your choice. You must decide for yourself whether you are going to love or not. The power of our choice is highlighted in moments when demons are trying to deceive, tempt, torment, or afflict us. If there’s a raw spot for them to rub, they will. However, if you’ve walked through healing, you get to make choices of Love to complete the healing process. It can be difficult sometimes, but it’s very worth it! 

Most choices between Love and selfishness are like coming up on a frontage or access road. If we exit from the highway of our Father’s will onto a parallel route, we won’t have to accelerate— because it’s all downhill! We race down at high speeds, which can produce excitement. Eventually, we come to a dead end, where we’re trapped in the dark or crash if we aren’t careful. This exit represents selfish choices, usually motivated by self- pity, self-hatred, or self-protection. Choosing self leads us downhill on a road of feeding our flesh. The part of us that’s supposed to be dying daily loves the euphoria of going downhill. Once self-focus is chosen, we feel empowered to taste an addiction (food, sex, alcohol, fantasizing) or an emotion (anger, desire to control). The end result is a crash in the dark, leading to depression, isolation, and resignation. 

How do we avoid crashes? Simple: stay on the road! We choose to say no to selfishness and yes to peace, joy, and righteousness! When we do, we take the Kingdom further into the amazing frontier of Love!

Our goal is perfection (Matt. 5:48), but perfection doesn’t mean without flaws; it means maturity. When we yield our lives daily to our Father, pursuing the portion of His will done set aside for us, He can bring Love to creation through us. Giving up your life brings you into His family, but daily denial of self brings maturity. Those who yield their will to God are righteous. With that choice, our Father can do what eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor mind conceived. 

YES, NOW!!! 

“Simply let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.” Matthew 5:37 

At times, the Lord commands, invites, or calls us to things we simply cannot do. In those moments, we can say “yes, however.” We tell the truth that we want to do what God is asking but admit we’re unable do it. We throw ourselves at His throne of mercy and ask Him to save us. Our Father, it turns out, is in the saving business! He honors us with great grace and responds to our dependency on Him with blessing. He will help you get to the place where you’re able to say yes. He won’t override your free will, but He will help you! 

That being said, it needs to be clearly stated that when we don’t do what we’re asked to do in His timing, there is detriment that results. There are people our Father wants to heal, land He wants to liberate, resources He wants to release, and inheritance He wants to pour out. The timing of our response directly impacts if or when this will happen. We have seen people die because something wasn’t chosen in the Lord’s timing! It’s absolutely critical that we learn to choose Love and do so immediately without hesitation! 

“. . . the work of the law written in their hearts.” Romans 2:15a (YLT) 

As we drive the Ferrari at high speeds, we must be able to follow the road wherever it goes. When the Father’s will is to “veer left,” we must respond immediately to avoid driving off the road. If we come to a fork, we must be able to hear His voice and

discern which way is good, which is better, and which is the very best. The Lord has built these skill sets into our DNA and written the instructions on our hearts. All that’s left is learning our roles for operating this mighty hardware. 

SHIP’S COMPLEMENT 

Our Ferrari isn’t just any Ferrari. It’s a big one! This vehicle is so big we could call it a ship! With that picture in mind, let’s compare our Kingdom responsibilities to the crew positions of a maritime vessel. The easiest position to identify is our captain, or the master, of the ship. Guess who that is? You’re right! It’s Jesus Christ, King of kings and Lord of lords. Jesus calls the shots as our head, listening to the will of our Father and commanding us all to follow those ordinances to the letter. 

Jesus gives all steering orders to the helmsman. There’s only one problem. The person at the helm is not a man; it’s a woman! Our Father designed women to have a form of spiritual discernment unique to their gender. Their job is to hear Jesus’ navigation, “Pothole right ahead!” or “Fork coming up! Take the road on the right for the best route!” The problem comes when men don’t give women the steering wheel. This has a horrendous impact on the whole ship! 

If women’s discernment isn’t heeded, meaning they aren’t given the steering wheel, Jesus turns and locks the wheel to the right. He then puts the engine at putt-putt speed, and we go “around the mountain,” not reaching the Promised Land until they’re given the wheel. Why would He do this? The road has many turns, and without women’s discernment, we could miss a turn, go off-road, or even crash the Ferrari. Once women are given the wheel, Jesus will unlock it and turn off putt-putt mode so we can race forward to our destiny! 

What position do men hold? Our Father in Heaven has given the blueprints of the Ferrari to the chief engineer. Men are called to build the ship, keep it in good working order, and then fix any problems that occur. Men are fixers! If women try to keep them from repairing things when they go wrong, they will shut down the Ferrari.

“Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.” Ephesians 5:21 (KJV) 

Here’s where we can get tripped up. Men may mistakenly believe that because they are the “head” of women (1 Cor. 11:3), men must control the wheel. Without the ability to obey Jesus and steer, women can get clogged up with discernment on what we should be doing. Men may falsely accuse them of being overly emotional or, in extreme cases, insane. Through their experiences or their foremothers’, women may learn to hold back on speaking until they’re brimming with discernment, like volcanoes ready to erupt. Women may sit down with their husbands to express all the pent-up emotions coming from their experience. Men often try to fix the problems, but the women don’t want a fix; they just want to be heard, understood, and known. The women are frustrated. The men are frustrated. Everyone needs some help!

In summary, our ship is meant to be built by men using blueprints provided by the Father. We’re then to be led by Jesus, who gives speed and steering directions to the women. Women hear these instructions using their gift of discernment. The men maintain and fix the ship when needed. The Father also wants the vessel to grow over time. He gives new blueprints to the men who share this with the women, and the new plans get implemented. When we follow this complementary design, our living ship will constantly grow while speeding along to the Promised Land.

KEY 

In the Church’s adult season, the Kingdom of God is like a Ferrari meant to be driven with great power and high speeds, but only on the road of our Father’s will. We must learn to drive with precision and wisdom to keep from going off-road into selfishness and away from Love, which can hurt ourselves, others, or the Kingdom.

Chapter Eight 

The Heart 

“[The shepherds] hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen Him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.” Luke 2:16–19 

Can you imagine what it was like for Mary? She knew her son would be called the Son of the Most High and rule over the house of Jacob in an everlasting Kingdom (Luke 1:32–33). After Jesus’ birth, she received confirmation after confirmation that what she’d seen and heard was real. First, she experienced the virgin birth of her son. Then, she was amazed by the words of a righteous man named Simeon and the prophetess Anna, who both spoke over Jesus when He was presented at the temple. She watched the Lord perform miracles to move her family to Egypt and escape the wrath of King Herod. Mary truly knew who Jesus was! 

“The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in His heart: ‘Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creature, as I have done.’” Genesis 8:21 (NIV 1984)

When Jesus was born, He didn’t remember who He was. His soul, like ours, had no memories of what happened before birth. His spirit was with the Father as it had always been, but His body and soul were formed in His mother’s womb. God gave Mary the task of teaching Jesus what the angel said about Him and how those words were confirmed. Through wisdom, revelation, and the teaching of rabbis, He grew quickly. Through the supernatural grace of God, He remained true to His calling. What made Jesus unique was that He had His Father’s heart, not Joseph but Yahweh. Jesus had a pure heart! His intentions were always good. Mary’s virgin birth gave Jesus the key benefit of not having a heart tainted by generational sins passed on by an earthly father. We’ve all been commissioned to do everything Jesus did, so we must receive the Father’s heart, too. That’s our next prerogative! 

“For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son.” John 3:16a 

Unlike Jesus, who is God’s only begotten Son, each of us was born through a human father. This has been true since Cain was born to Adam. Moreover, every man since Adam has sinned. For this reason, the Lord has allowed consequences to pass down to each father’s descendants to the fourth generation, their great- grandchildren (Num. 14:18). We were born with tainted hearts that reflect the selfish choices that were made before we were born. This condition must be dismantled so our hearts can be free hunger after God’s goodness. Habits of self-centered desires must be broken so we are truly liberated. 

“Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.” Psalm 51:10 

The word ‘heart,’ from the Hebrew primitive root לֵבָב, transliterated lawbab (H3823), reflects our appetites and passions. The heart is the source of our desires and intentions. It’s what drives our actions and choices to either Love or not-Love. Our heart is the decision mechanism for whether or not we feed the kingdom of darkness with sin that provides it power and authority. But if the inclinations of our heart are evil from the day we’re born, how will we be rescued from this body of death (Rom. 7:24–25)?

“Jesus answered, ‘I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.’” John 3:5–6 (NIV 1984) 

First, we must be born again through the choice of believing in Jesus Christ as Savior. Entering covenant with Him radically affects us. This revolutionary transformation is an experience that most people remember forever. When we’re born again, we receive our Father’s DNA in Heaven, which changes our hearts to His. We begin to love in ways we’ve never known before. We begin to want what God wants. We hunger and thirst for more of Him. We have a greater measure of His compassion, peace, joy, and grace. 

Unfortunately, we all know from experience that not all of our soul agrees with this choice of belief. When a soul is splintered from trauma, the wounded parts maintain old mindsets contrary to the new life we chose by accepting Jesus as Savior. Each splinter’s free will rebels against our choice of Jesus and operates from those wounds. Their involvement comes with fear, anger, rebellion, addiction to pleasure, control, deception, distrust, doubt, and pride. 

“The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.” Romans 8:19–21 (NIV 1984) 

The integration of the human soul completes the process of mending our hearts, reconciling us to our heavenly Father’s DNA. This is how we become more fully God’s sons and daughters. Why is creation groaning for God’s children to be revealed? We will liberate it from the decay coming from the choices of early humans to rebel against the Father’s will. We’ve been irrevocably called! We don’t love our lives so much as to shrink from death, so we’re able to mature and receive the power and authority God has set aside for us. All of creation will be rescued from detriment and released into the fullness of its destiny.

The enemy’s schemes and strategies to keep this from being fulfilled are vast. To prevent judgment from occurring, evil works to prevent the Church from maturing enough to become the complete Bride of Jesus. The entire kingdom of darkness wants power and authority to maintain its existence and will freely deceive to get it. If people believe their lies and choose to sin, the evil ones get to steal, kill, and destroy. It’s important to remember that satan does not create but perverts. It’s through this process he plans to trap the people of God forever. 

IMAGINING 

“All day long I have held out My hands to an obstinate people, who walk in ways not good, pursuing their own imaginations.” Isaiah 65:2 

God created us in His image. He provided our imagination as a place we can go and see His power mix with the building blocks of the universe; it is a space for us to create. He meets us there, and we can travel to the throne room of God, to various days in history, or even to the other side of the universe. In this space, we receive His revelation, discern pure from impure, see the future, and dream of ways to improve things. This is God’s design for us, and it’s good! 

“The Lord detests the thoughts of the wicked, but those of the pure are pleasing to Him.” Proverbs 15:26 (NIV 1984) 

The direction our imagination goes is driven from the heart, so the fruit can be good or bad. When its source is the spirit of a man or woman of God, the output is Love; we experience our imagination with God and, therefore, from the root of purity. When the source is a soul splinter, the output is not-Love, or selfishness. The enemy knows that wicked thoughts bring him power and authority, so he camps out there. We must continue as royal priests, dismantling this back door into our lives by integrating our hearts: first, by forgiving those parts with the blood of Jesus, then repenting and forgiving those who hurt us. Old patterns of behavior remaining in us must be dealt with through discipline. As adults, we must choose to hold ourselves accountable for our thoughts through confession. The enemy

---
<p style="text-align:center;">
- 92 -

</p> 
{ #p92}

wants to tempt us with pleasure, comfort, and escape via impure imaginations. Afterward, satan wants us to hide the fact that we sinned. Instead, choose the Light. Confess and repent. If the behavior continues unabated, ask the Lord for a consequence to help you, but do not allow the evil one to steal from you even one more time! 

THE FANTASY CONNECTION 

“Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore stand in awe of God.” Ecclesiastes 5:7 (NIV 1984) 

The extent of satan’s attempts to lure us away from God is astounding. The evil one always tempts with deception that starts sweet but leaves a bitter aftertaste. He takes advantage of our pre-existing discomfort to build a case for straying away. Demons recognize when we’re bored, uncomfortable, or in pain. They see when we’ve been rejected, betrayed, abandoned, and neglected. It’s at the point of our greatest vulnerability that the snake strikes. 

Fantasies are idolatrous “daydreams” that bring us comfort in lieu of turning to God as our source of relief. The enemy has worked with humans to make our imagination a space where “good things” happen to us. Regrettably, these are scenarios that feed the aggrandizement of self. When we’re growing and excelling, these figments are often directed toward blatant self- glory. For more mature Christians, the enemy has learned to disguise these fantasies with “good conquering evil” themes, yet underneath is a hidden agenda of us getting what we want. 

There are many examples of how this can work. People who are ambitious or suffering from monotony in their occupation may dream of success and personal advancement. This can be related to where they’re currently employed, by visualizing themselves getting a promotion or a raise, or where they want to be, by becoming a national leader or executive. Those who feel rejected may dream of being adored as a rock star, sports hero, or legendary actor, or they may seek adoration as an author or film director. Those who feel neglected may dream of having their love needs met through romantic operettas on distant shores. Those who are bored or in pain may dream of pleasure via sexual

fantasies or of comfort, perhaps by being independently wealthy. When self-motivated, these kinds of imaginations are distractions from the calling God has for our lives. 

“But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.” 2 Corinthians 11:3 

The enemy uses imaginations as foundations for building intricate strongholds of evil in our lives. Demons have had plenty of time to get the process right. Without a solution, we become buried in a pile of rubble too heavy to be freed from. There is no mercy in their plan. Again, evil’s agenda is to keep us sinning and not maturing. The evil one has been very successful at both goals for thousands of years, and we’re a swing away from striking out. 

Our response must be quick and sure. We must take accountability for these daydreams. It’s imperative that we integrate any wounded, splintered parts of our soul seeking to fantasize. Additionally, we must dismantle any generational sins that bring power to the enemy’s temptation. Finally, we must stand guard over our thoughts. When a temptation comes to enter into fantasy to provide something for ourselves, we must resist and freely choose to keep our thoughts on the Lord. Stay focused on the present moment, not the past or future. Train your minds with new habits that are always with Him! 

THE CROWDED HOUSE

“He is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.” James 1:8 (NIV 1984)

Once the enemy successfully splinters our soul, gets our approval to promote impure thoughts, and lures us into idolatrous fantasies, their master plan is in place. Each splinter feeds on the dreams of the life it desires and then grows, becoming more powerful until dominant personalities emerge in a person over time. These start small but become more prominent and outwardly recognizable parts of our known persona. Many Christians have these and accept them as a

natural part of themselves, not realizing that these are mature splinters working in tandem to rebel and overthrow the spirit within them. 

God created us to be single-minded with a single personality. By definition, two or more personalities in a person is a crowded house. This is a hidden strategy of the enemy’s agenda to win the war. To be clear, each of our personalities have multiple expressions that reflect the Father’s heart. He created us to be rich and textured, with beauty meant to be viewed from different angles. However, we aren’t meant to be broken, fragmented, splintered, and divided against ourselves. 

There are many examples of splinters growing into personalities. An ambitious person who is shy may develop an outgoing personality. Those who are afraid may develop angry personalities that confront others to keep themselves from being hurt. Those who’ve been rejected may find an identity in using their irrevocable gifts to steal God’s glory, what we might call “a wounded counselor.” Those who’ve been neglected may become flirtatious to the point of committing adultery or adultery of the heart. Those seeking pleasure may develop personalities connected to sexual fetishes (cross-gender, desiring to be a predator or victim). Those seeking comfort may habitually overspend, gamble, go into debt, and live beyond their means. 

As with an “electric onion” (layers of splinters protecting an authoritative central one), we must unplug these strongholds at the source. That means integrating key splinters and dismantling any demonic power supply, which is the sin involved. Once we’ve ended that influence, the obstacle remaining is ourselves: we have extensive patterns of behavior that must be repented of. This can happen all at once or be spread out over time. Often, we’ve hurt others and ourselves through these false personalities. All of this must be undone. 

It's so important that we rest in daily bread portions of our Father’s will. It’s too easy for us to take on this kind of healing as a burden and be weighed down by it. Please know that no one wants us healed more than God does. He prioritizes our recovery in all things, but He also sees the big picture. He knows how every step fits into the fullness of creation and the objectives of

Love. We get the privilege of living in the greatest state of grace known in the universe. When we yield to God every day, pursuing and asking Him for our daily bread, there is no condemnation for us. The enemy cannot bring the same accusation again. Trust God in His timing, continue to repent and forgive as He shows you, and rest. Does it get any easier? 

THE HOUSE OF SAUL

“As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore. Samuel said to him, ‘The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors—to one better than you.’” 1 Samuel 15:27–28 

If a person of God has a soul splinter that’s allowed to dream impure fantasies and develops into a dominant, second personality (or more), that person will belong to the house of Saul. When the same person has been designed by God to receive a great amount of responsibility (Matt. 25:15), these personalities are extremely damaging to the Kingdom. The sons and daughters of God with the most authority have the ability to lead multitudes astray. We must fight on behalf of these brothers and sisters in hopes that they will join the house of David. 

You will know them by their fruit: they are double-minded. On one side, they speak the truth in Love. On the other, they are self- centered. The key to knowing what house they belong to is identifying which personality dominates: the person of God or the splinter. The splinter is wounded, and that part is easy to find; they’re jealous, manipulative, and controlling. At the end of a time of testing, they will ask, “What’s in it for me?” or, “What am I getting out of this?” These are fathers who don’t bless their grandchildren because, by definition, it could mean that their sons and daughters have exceeded them. 

“As they danced, they sang: ‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.’ Saul was very angry; this refrain galled him. ‘They have credited David with tens of thousands,’ he thought, ‘but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?’” 1 Samuel 18:7–8 (NIV 1984)

The house of Saul behaves this way because it is deceived. The Lord has called His adult sons and daughters, those of the House of David who have His heart, to go and rescue the house of Saul.
In the past we would have had to leave them to the vultures, but not this time! Now we have the authority and power to dismantle this deception. Forgiving all those whose sins would
contribute to the theft of our family. Hurling down the accuser with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. The Lord is waiting for us to ask Him to intervene with Truth! The
moment we do, He will act and swiftly! If judgment begins in the House of the Lord, then so does the rescue mission: let’s get our family free so we can be strong and go get the rest!

“Who may stand in his holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart.” Psalm 24:3-4

KEY

Our heart (intention, desire) was made impure by our earthly fathers. Through the DNA restoration that comes from salvation through Christ Jesus, the power of the Holy Spirit, and the
commission of the Father, we can receive a pure heart. Once our soul is integrated and healed, we can become the full children of God who have the same heart Jesus did.

 Chapter Nine 
 
 Jericho 
 
 “At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: ‘Cursed before the Lord is the one who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho: At the cost of his firstborn son he will lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.’” Joshua 6:26
 
  The Lord taught Joshua that the Israelites were called to be free from contamination and pollution. Every time the nation slipped into selfishness, it gave the evil one legal rights to interfere with the Father’s will in their lives. Because of this, the Lord inspired Joshua to declare to the people that enough was enough: it was time to stay pure and faithful. God’s people needed to demonstrate holiness through loyalty to the One who saved them time and time again. When Joshua pronounced that anyone who rebuilt Jericho would be cursed, it was a manifestation of that revelation concerning purity. 
  
  “When the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites—the land He swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey . . .” Exodus 13:5a 
  
  The Lord promised land to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Gen. 50:24). In Hebrew, a root word connected to ‘promise’ is shaba (H7650), which, in its verb form, also means “to swear.”

With God, a promise or oath is a solemn and very serious matter. God stands by His word and places all His resources into ensuring what He says comes to pass. The Lord is always faithful to His word and what He speaks out to His people as a shevu’ah (promise).

DEFEATED ENEMIES

“‘Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did also the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites, but I gave them into your hands. I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you—also the two Amorite kings. You did not do it with your own sword and bow. So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build; and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’” Joshua 24:11–13 

There is no burden of responsibility when someone freely gives you a victory, especially when it was promised as a part of an oath (shevu’ah). The Lord faithfully fulfills all the promises He’s made to His people from a place of rest. He calls for us to yield to His will being done in daily bread portions. When we do, we’re the righteous and faithful people through whom our Father could even rescue Sodom and Gomorrah. Our will is surrendered to His, allowing Him to move through us in His perfect timing, sequence, and quantity. Our Father is trustworthy. He wants to do all of the work! We’re called to believe this and rest.

“Now fear the Lord and serve Him with all faithfulness.” Joshua 24:14a 

THE VIOLENT 

“Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.” Matthew 11:11–14

While sharing the revelation concerning John the Baptist’s identity, Jesus described a condition of people “storming Heaven.” Unfortunately, this verse has been used somewhat carelessly over the last few decades. For example, many people have received prophecies from brothers and sisters that rang true at the time but haven’t yet come to pass. Many of these prophecies are viewed as promises that belong to us but must be aggressively pursued so they’re not lost to the enemy. People have been declaring the fulfillment of these words to bring life to them (Prov. 18:21). For some, it’s even become a mandate to raid Heaven by force to take those promises, as they’re considered our property. Eventually, this process of grabbing at what belongs to us from God, instead of yielding to daily bread portions, has resulted in angry and hurt people with a growing accusation against their creator. Was this what Jesus intended? Who are these “violent people” that Jesus said were taking Heaven by force? 

To understand what Jesus was talking about, we must go to the book of Malachi, which has the core scriptures that prophesied the coming of John the Baptist (Mal. 3:1, 4:5, etc.). Jesus was referencing these passages when He made the statement about raiding Heaven. Starting in chapter two, we find the Lord identifying those within His people who are unfaithful, those who entered a covenant with anything that wasn’t Love: 

“Judah has been unfaithful. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the Lord loves by marrying women who worship a foreign god. As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the Lord remove him from the tents of Jacob—even though he brings an offering to the Lord Almighty. 

Another thing you do: You flood the Lord’s altar with tears. You weep and wail because He no longer looks with favor on your offerings or accepts them with pleasure from your hands. You ask, ‘Why?’ It is because the Lord is the witness between you and the wife of your youth. You have been unfaithful to her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.” Malachi 2:11–14

As with a covenant of marriage, unfaithfulness in our covenant with the Lord is sin. The wages of sin are decay, which leads to death. Selfishness results in separation from Him, which produces a need for the restoration that comes from Jesus’s blood. This separation removes God’s favor from our lives and has a very tangible impact on our joy. We notice a clear difference, so much so that it causes us to cry out to God again. 

“‘The man who hates and divorces his wife,’ says the Lord, the God of Israel, ‘does violence to the one he should protect,’ says the Lord Almighty.” Malachi 2:16a 

The identity of “the violent” Jesus referenced in Matthew 11:11– 14 concerns those who are unfaithful to covenant. That description was not a compliment, commission, or recommendation. The Lord is not calling us to storm Heaven and take what we want. That is selfishness, which by definition, is not Love. It’s the polar opposite of yielding to daily bread of His will being done. It’s demanding our will done in our sequence, quantity, or timing. 

“You have wearied the Lord with your words. ‘How have we wearied Him?’ you ask. By saying, ‘All who do evil are good in the eyes of the Lord, and He is pleased with them’ or ‘Where is the God of justice?’” Malachi 2:17 

The Lord has become exhausted listening to the prayers of people that employ Jesus’ name outside of His will. We might perceive these prayers as being ignored by God when, in fact, they’re outside of His covenant with us! The common result is that we eventually end up accusing God of withholding from us, a view that literally makes us an accuser! If we believe this false mindset, we must immediately repent and return to the covenant He has for us. We’re called to lose our self-life to gain His life in us! We’re called to repent and rest (Isa. 30:15). 

Prophecies given from one person to another are not meant to dictate the future. If that were so, it would affect the receiver’s freewill choices, which would invalidate the prerequisites of Love. All prophecies are descriptions of our identity, gifts, and irrevocable callings in the Lord. They’re pictures of how God designed us to be. As with all of our predestined calls, we’re

Jericho given invitations that must be accepted daily, even when times of testing come. Our life is daily submission to His will, which brings about the fullness of every promise found within prophecies spoken over us. Salvation is a free gift, but producing fruit costs us everything. When we lay down our lives, God can resurrect in us what He planned all along. That provision includes sanctifying our souls and fulfilling His covenants with us. 

COVENANT FULFILLMENT

“The Lord said to Joshua, ‘Stand up! What are you doing down on your face? Israel has sinned; they have violated My covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions. That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.’” Joshua 7:10–12 

When Achan, the son of Karmi of the tribe of Judah, coveted and kept for himself the beautiful robe, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, he violated the covenant between Israel and God. From this one sin, thirty-six Israelite soldiers were killed by the army of Ai. Our Father has called His people to be faithful to our covenant with Him, just as He is faithful to us. When we’re unfaithful, the covenant loses its power, and we lose access to His promises. 

“Then the Lord said to Joshua, ‘Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city.’ So Joshua held out toward the city the javelin that was in his hand. As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire.” Joshua 8:18–19 

The Lord restored His covenant with Israel when Achan and his family were stoned, burned, and buried. The Lord delivered the city into Joshua’s hand (tefakh, or ‘handbreadth’) to represent the covenant being restored. As Joshua and the Israelites continued

through the Promised Land, receiving the enemies that the Lord delivered to them, they weren’t warring for the land. The land was already theirs. They were fulfilling the covenant (Deut. 7:1– 2) the Lord made with them. God drove out the seven nations that were larger than Israel; their job was to complete the covenant through the destruction of evil present in the land. 

KEY 

We don’t have to take from God what He has committed to us by covenant. Our Father faithfully fulfills His covenants and promises when we faithfully rest by yielding to daily bread portions of His will being done.

Chapter Ten 

Forensics

“Come out of her, My people, so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues; for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.” Revelation 18:4b–5 

A serious crime has been committed. The children of God, created in His image, have been deceived since birth! We have been born into a world where the five senses rule our belief system. Many have been born into societies where there is little to no mention of the truth of our Father, Yahweh, and the good news of the Gospel of His son Jesus. Others have heard a version of the truth, but it’s terribly skewed in favor of the father of lies. Most have been raised to believe in what is considered practical and tangible. Risk-taking is only approved when there is a significant benefit to oneself. 

Every human on the planet has been victimized by this crime. Many have been traumatized. Some have been tortured. Most have been rejected, abandoned, betrayed, and neglected. These injuries started in the womb and continued through adulthood. The people of the world didn’t have a chance! Even though each person has been free to make their own choices, their worldview has been distorted through the manipulation of the most notorious of criminals.

“Then you must inquire, probe and investigate it thoroughly. . . . if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among you . . .” Deuteronomy 13:14–16 

The royal priests, the adult sons and daughters of God, have been called to minister to the Temple by rescuing their siblings from the bondage of decay. They have been called as investigators to solve the mystery of these crimes. Yet, the process for us is reversed. With crimes in the natural, you’re looking for the perpetrator, method, and motive. In the Kingdom, we already know all three of these things. What we’re looking for are the victims. 

CRIME SCENE 

“Nathan replied to David, ‘Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with you.’” 1 Chronicles 17:2 

The mind was created to be the environment we make choices in. The Lord has always intended for our soul to have pure input so our mind could remain pure as well. By remaining in the Light, we’re able to freely choose our inputs with the Truth, which is critical, as inputs have a great influence on our choices. Who are we interacting with? What are we looking at with our eyes? What are we listening to with our ears? What thoughts are we allowing? All of these things determine whether the mind is polluted or not. 

The will is the organ that makes choices within our soul. It is influenced either by the purity of our heart or the pollution of our mind. The enemy has plotted for millennia to manipulate the will of all humans. They use deception in darkness that leads to sin. Once sin is chosen, the enemy camp obtains the valuable legal rights they need to steal, kill, and destroy for up to three to four more generations. 

Our emotions are meant to be an expressional output from our will. In other words, they should follow our choices. Big problems occur when our emotions begin to dysfunction! This can happen after continuous wounding from hurtful choices

we’ve made or from the trespasses of others. Instead of our will affecting our emotions, the opposite happens, and our emotions influence our will to make choices contrary to our true heart. 

Likewise, our body can also be a crime scene. The decay that comes from sin can cause a lot of sickness and pain. Both of these side effects can have serious influence on our choices. Our will is also significantly impacted by addictions, as the body has a physiological ability to crave things it’s become addicted to (taste, sugar, other chemicals). 

Once the mind, emotions, or body control the will, it becomes their slave, and as a result, we become enslaved. As royal priests, the crime scene we’re investigating is the soul and body of anyone who needs liberated, specifically, any part that has been conditioned as a welcome mat for the enemy’s schemes. To return creation to the original design of Love, we must see the mind, emotions, and body healed from wounding, dysfunction, and addictions. We must identify who the victims are so they can be rescued and restored. The surprise twist to this story is that the victims who’ve been targeted by the enemy are not just the people of the earth; the victims are within us! 

VICTIMS 

“Woe to the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without victims!” Nahum 3:1 

All humans are victims, including predators. Every person has been targeted by the father of lies’ schemes. But the hidden victims are the parts of our soul that splintered off whenever we were traumatized, rejected, abandoned, betrayed, and neglected (TRABN). These soul wounds are hidden under layers of personality that mask them; they’re concealed as a protection from exposure to shame and to protect others from the harmful nature of the splinter’s behavior. These masks have some benefits but are mostly detrimental. Our job is to see beyond the layers to find the victim so we can rescue each one.

“For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it . . .” Romans 8:20

<p style="text-align:center;">
- 107 -

</p> 
{ #p107}


---

Creation is a victim as well! Perhaps more so, as creation did not choose to eat the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Additionally, the historical sins of humans remembered in creation create layers of concealment that can hide victims. These sins can go back thousands of years and seem near infinite in number. There are people who committed sins long ago that don’t exist in any human records. The only chronicle is in Heaven, where the Lord remembers their deeds. By the Light of His Presence, God’s adult sons and daughters have access to this spiritual database so we can forgive those who sinned, hurling down the accuser with the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. Then the Lord will remember these sins no more.

INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES 

“The priest is to go and examine it and, if the mold has spread in the house, it is a persistent defiling mold; the house is unclean.” Leviticus 14:44 

When we minister as priests to the Temple of God, who are our siblings in Christ (1 Cor. 3:16), we start our “crime scene investigation” by joining with those the Lord has called us to serve with that day. Together, we ask the Lord to shine His Light in the life of the person we’re ministering to. The Light will reveal the hidden sins the enemy is using as a legal right to torment, afflict, and otherwise harm the person. This is how we penetrate the layers of masks that are intricately designed to preserve splinters. It’s very important that we remember to ask the Lord to give the person we’re praying for their daily bread of His will done. That way, they’re getting the perfect quantity of all He’s allocated for that day. The Lord’s plan for us is always best! 

Once the Light is shining on a person, there are two paths to choose from: listening in the spirit or observation in the natural. The Lord has gifted some royal priests to do little besides listening to His voice. They will receive spiritual pictures, sounds, visions, thoughts, or understanding that are critical jigsaw puzzle pieces or bread crumbs. These ministers’ present what they receive from the Lord to their siblings, who minister with them in unity for the Father’s will to be done.

OBSERVATION 

“So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand.” Ecclesiastes 7:25a 

Observation is fundamental to our investigation of the crime scene. There are some royal priests whose gifting from the Lord is to observe natural behavior. This supernaturally enhanced gift can be developed with experience and allows a royal priest to see behavior and hear testimonies that help identify the wounded part of a person. This, combined with the Light of God’s Presence and some basic understanding of how splinters work, enables a royal priest to uncover any layers masking a victim. 

Soul wounds leave a trail of carnage that is easy to spot if you know what you’re looking for. To keep the process as simple as possible, we will focus on the Core Splinters first: they are the Child (S1), exhibiting fear, self-pity, and despair; the Bodyguard (S2), producing anger, self-protection, and self-justice; the Rebel (S3), full of defiance and self-motivation; the Addict (S4), who self-sources with pleasure and stimulation; and the Loner (S5), who embodies manipulation, control, and isolation. 

Observation in ministry is a process of asking questions, hearing answers, and noticing behavior. When someone has requested ministry and prayer, we always start by asking people what the Lord is saying to them. The more you live in and minister from the Light in your own life, the more you’ll find that the Lord prepares people before they receive ministry by revealing hidden things to them. You can often discover this treasure trove of root issues simply by asking. The following chart contains examples:

Terraforming RESToration Many of the symptoms we observe could come from several potential roots or splinters (victims). This is one example of why we need our observations to connect with our ever-growing discernment. That way, we can hear the Lord’s confirmation and direction about what has truly happened. It’s important our soul doesn’t lead us but that we allow our spirit to remain the authority on whether or not we minister to something we observe. 

There are times when a person hasn’t heard anything from the Lord before the ministry, which could be the issue, or they are unwilling or unable to express it to you. When this happens, it’s not a problem as long as you’re hearing the Lord’s voice. He will fill in any gaps that the person cannot tell you directly. Trust Him completely as you minister to the person. Your relationship with God will always be the foundation for ministry. The source of the Love you’re giving to the person is the Spirit of Christ within you.

Any examples we give are meant to be helpful illustrations of how the pattern of prayer ministry works. We cannot and will not provide a formula for how to exactly minister to each person because it would be contrary to God’s nature and our call as royal priests. The Lord does want us to know His processes, which include daily bread, trusting in His Light for revelation of root issues and sins, and our authority to dismantle the rights of evil through the fullness of forgiveness, by the blood of Jesus and our testimony of being purified, redeemed, and restored. Here are a few more examples:

Symptom Possible Root Splinter Emotionally numb Emotions locked in prison Jailer (S12) Can’t remember childhood Emotional prison plus trauma Child (S1) and Jailer (S12) Work to prevent conflict Fear of rejection, abandonment Child (S1) and Peacemaker (S17) Controlling personality Self-protection Bodyguard (S2) and Loner (S5) Sexual addiction after rape Love awakened too soon Child (S1), Addict (S4), Malfunctioning Alarm Clock (S18) Overweight Low self-esteem Child (S1), The Dessert (S23) Nothing is wrong with me Blessing “valuable” control Loner (S5), Blind Spot (S19)

For us walk in covenant with God, we must be able to yield to Him, which requires trust. We need to be open to receive the fullness of ministry the Lord has for us to be healed. Daily bread of sanctification is a critical piece for growing deeper in intimacy, with clean hands and a pure heart. Soul wounds are our greatest enemy in the pursuit of becoming the Bride of Christ. For those who hunger for Him more than anything, we must

abandon ourselves to the will of the Father. We must pursue becoming free of all self-focus, which only comes from depending on God as our source of everything, in every moment of our lives. While we may trip, we must never fall and stay down. Let’s get up and get back to resting! Here are some splinters that can affect our ability to see our covenant with God:

Splinter Affect on seeing the covenant The Lost Boys (S14) Doesn’t want to take responsibility of fulfilling covenant The Eve (S16) Cannot see beauty, accuses God of neglect The Blind Spot (S19) Refusal to see and deal with sin halts fulfillment of covenant The Adam (S24) Avoids God to keep from being exposed The Razor (S25) Avoids God’s discipline; do it yourself, don’t bother God The Settler (S26) Rejects the fullness of covenant blessing The Peter Pan (S27) Refuses to accept the responsibility of fulfilling covenant The Cross (S28) Accuses God of injustice

GENERATIONAL COVENANTS 

Every generation alive today has a covenant with the Lord. These covenants are part of our irrevocable calling. They highlight how we can participate in equipping the saints to prepare the Bride for her wedding day. Because of these callings, the enemy has targeted each generation in an attempt to bring corporate stumbling blocks to shut down their destiny. As a part of healing people and ministering to the Temple, we must deal with these corporate wounds as led by our Father in His perfect timing! Here are a few:

Generation Covenant and Blessing  Splinter

 FILTERING 
 
 “Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.” Job 34:4 
 
 There will be times when the symptoms we identify do not have root issues from splinters but come purely through generational sins. These must be distinguished so we understand that some of the things we struggle with are inherited, not necessarily from an injury that happened directly to us. It’s also possible and common for the side effects of generational sin to interact with splinter behavior and create a cocktail of trouble. The good news is that dismantling these things is easy. We just trust His Light! Here are a few examples: 
 
 Symptom 
        
 Possible Generational Sin 
 
 “Incubus” nighttime torment 
       
 Witchcraft / idolatry Ceremony dedicating children 
 
 Prostate cancer Idolatry of control mixed with severe falsehood 
 
 Urge to lie, steal, or destroy 
 
 Witchcraft / idolatry Ritual marriage ceremony to lucifer
 
 Integrating splinters and healing these wounds require the new wineskin of the adulthood of the Church. We must receive the anointing that comes with Jesus’ commission: to identify hidden sins in the Light of God’s Presence in daily bread portions. With those Keys, we can strip enemy rights with the fullness of forgiveness. We sprinkle any splinters with the blood of Jesus, declaring that they are purified and redeemed. We are then restored back to the child of God we were created to be: whole, complete, unified, and integrated. We can then hurl down the accuser because their accusation is nullified by Jesus’ blood and our testimony. 
 
 “Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.” Revelation 3:19

For those who want fullness in Christ more than anything, our last step is to yield to the discipline of the Lord. Our God has created a process of healing habits through accountability where we confess our sins to one another, specifically to the person(s) He has brought into our lives for that purpose. Don’t hide in the dark! When we live in the Light, we’re set free in the Light, so pursue the Truth with all that you are!

KEY 

A terrible crime has been committed against the children of God by a liar who hides in the dark. God’s adult sons and daughters have been commissioned to investigate these crimes. We will learn to identify and rescue victims using extensive techniques of observation and discernment in the spirit realm.

Chapter Eleven

Business

“If you fear the Lord and serve and obey Him and do not rebel against His commands, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the Lord your God—good! But if you do not obey the Lord, and if you rebel against His commands, His hand will be against you, as it was against your fathers.” 1 Samuel 12:14–15 (NIV 1984) 

When the Lord first released the Keys to liberate creation from the bondage of decay, He gave us a Terraforming strategy for business. Since then, we’ve been expecting to talk more about how to use the Keys in that setting. Some anticipated it being a strategy for business leaders (owners and employees) to become increasingly successful and prosperous, with the goal of better providing tithes and offerings to support the Kingdom. Surprisingly, as we’ve continued receiving the living Word of God, what we’ve found is that our Father has an even greater plan than we imagined (1 Cor. 2:9). This business strategy may not necessarily be what most would expect, but rest assured, the eternal ramifications of God’s plan are well beyond what we could come up with ourselves. The Lord is always looking at the big picture and how our choices of love affect all people across eternity.

To that end, the approach we’re being given is the best for the Church, not necessarily what we might want as individuals. Like all things in the Kingdom, strategy for business requires the death of our plans and the resurrection of God’s. That could mean very little change in what you are already doing. It could also require a complete overhaul. Whichever the case, those who choose to yield to God’s plan have a great reward in eternity. Many lives will be affected, including yours and your family’s. Jesus told us that the cost was high, but it was very much worth it. Using Tyre as a model, we will see God’s plan for business unfold, including what and what not to do.

BUSINESS FOUNDATIONS

“The word of the Lord came to me: ‘Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “In the pride of your heart you say, ‘I am a god; I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the seas.’ But you are a man and not a god, though you think you are as wise as a god.”’” Ezekiel 28:1–2 

The nation of Tyre was prominent in the days of David (1000 BC) and Daniel (500 BC). They provided resources for Solomon to build David’s temple. They were a very successful nation in every way except for their leader’s heart, especially at the beginning of Daniel’s life. At that time, its king was filled with pride and self-centeredness. The choices he made resulted in great calamity for Tyre.

“Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt. Speak to him and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, you great monster lying among your streams. You say, ‘The Nile is mine; I made it for myself.’”’” Ezekiel 29:2–3 

The Pharaohs also struggled with pride and the lust for power and, therefore, suffered the same fate as Tyre’s king. These are examples for us of the importance of being set free of character flaws that can poison any business. Each of us must be healed of wounds that have made us self-protective, controlling of others, and ambitious. All generational roots of ambition, deception,

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p> 
{ #p118}


---

theft, and conspiracy against others must be removed from our DNA and dismantled through forgiveness with the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. 

“The word of the Lord came to me: ‘Son of man, take up a lament concerning Tyre. Say to Tyre, situated at the gateway to the sea, merchant of peoples on many coasts,“This is what the Sovereign Lord says: ‘You say, O Tyre, “I am perfect in beauty.” Your domain was on the high seas; your builders brought your beauty to perfection.’”’” Ezekiel 27:1–4 

Most businesses are built on the foundation of a human’s vision. Others are built upon God’s vision using the irrevocable gift of a person who received revelation for a good idea and then turned it into a successful endeavor. We want to go back to the drawing board and see redemption and blessing going forward. That doesn’t always mean throwing away what you’ve done in the past, but it certainly means being willing to do whatever the Lord shows you to do (Luke 9:23–24), which could include starting over. 

Each day, the Lord has set aside perfect portions of His will for us. He wants to provide us with a strategy in the same way He has everything else in our lives. If we yield to Him and receive daily bread crumbs at home and work, we will see radical changes that take us to His perfect plan. Whether your role is the owner, CEO, or an analyst doesn’t matter. That process is the same. The Lord wants to give us jigsaw puzzle pieces of His will each day. When these are put together to form a picture, we see the bigger view of His will. 

The Lord has a strategy for your business! In the past, you may have come up with an idea and way to make it happen. Apart from God, our plans are often polluted by wounds and ambitions that allow sins like deception, theft, and destruction. The Lord wants you to be successful without harming anyone so Love can be brought to the world. 

When I worked in the business world, strategies would come to me this way. While I can’t share specifics because of the intellectual properties of former employers, I can give an

example. One day, the Lord showed me something incredible about what we were doing. We found that when we offered Customer A a certain benefit, their customer, Customer B, also received a benefit for their downstream customers. This was revolutionary as it showed us that as an organization, we could build a strategy for business-owning clients that helped them improve the benefits they could offer their clientele. 

It changed our entire model from service provider to virtual consultant. We had the capability of improving our customers’ entire way of doing business! We did not attack our competitors when we sold; we focused entirely on the benefits to our customers! No deception, no theft, and no destruction were required. The strategy was brilliant. There was no way for any of us to have come up with this on our own. No one in the industry ever had. By receiving our daily bread of revelation, we connected the dots one day, and it all made sense. No matter what you’re doing, the Lord can do the same for you! 

“Tarshish did business with you because of your great wealth of goods; they exchanged silver, iron, tin and lead for your merchandise.” Ezekiel 27:12 

When you yield to your Father’s will done, the quality of your goods or services begins to shift toward excellence. In everything that the Lord does, there is perfection. The Lord helped us take existing products and make them better easily! We did not spend a lot of money changing things; we simply took what we had and added the benefits we didn’t realize were already available. One example was adding consultation to our products. The innovative ideas that came from God blew our customers’ socks off! We simply taught them how to do what God showed us!!! 

“Aram did business with you because of your many products; they exchanged turquoise, purple fabric, embroidered work, fine linen, coral and rubies for your merchandise.” Ezekiel 27:16

When we first reviewed our product set, it seemed very vanilla and plain. Through daily bread of the Lord’s supernatural strategy, we ended with the best set in the industry. It took a little over a year, but it happened. For example, we took what we

already had and repackaged single products with multiple uses as multiple products. In the end, we had a variety of ways for our customers to serve their customers at a single cost. By adding good marketing that told the good news well, our clients couldn’t believe what they were seeing! 

“The men of Rhodes traded with you, and many coastlands were your customers; they paid you with ivory tusks and ebony.” Ezekiel 27:15 

What an amazing picture of the Kingdom of God! As moths are drawn to light, the Lord will build the same draw toward what He calls you to. When I quit my job, we had a record customer count! Why? Because what the Lord built was that good! Our Father has a plan for business that will affect everything you do. Everything you touch will have His touch on it! That means there will be many who love you and what you do. If you follow the Lord, there may be those who hate you, but it isn’t really you that they’re against; it’s the Lord Himself! 

“In the eleventh month of the twelfth year, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me: ‘Son of man, because Tyre has said of Jerusalem, “Aha! The gate to the nations is broken, and its doors have swung open to me; now that she lies in ruins I will prosper,” therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, like the sea casting up its waves.’” Ezekiel 26:1–3 

Many of us were taught that to be the best in business, we had to crush the competition, steal their market share, and listen to the lamentations of their shareholders. We were told we had to use whatever tactic worked, even bordering on dishonesty and immoral practices. This is absolutely not true! The Lord will bless the sons and daughters He calls into business as agents of Love. These professionals will participate in changing the world! 

CHIEF CESSATION OFFICER (CCO) 

“And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God’s will.” Romans 8:27 (NIV 1984)

Every person in business can be a certified “cessor,” an intercessor who uses Kingdom Keys in the new wineskin of the Church. No matter what position you hold, you have the opportunity to pray. The key is to ask the Lord who’s in your field. Then, you can pray and pursue their covenant, how God sees them, just as Jesus intercedes for us. When you do this, you will always see fruit, and you will never be clogged up. Don’t pray for everyone but only those you’re called to. In addition, the more cessors that participate in your business, the bigger your field is, and therefore, the bigger the harvest! 

“Then Samuel said, ‘Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede with the Lord for you.’” 1 Samuel 7:5 

Who will you get to pray for? Some examples may include leaders in your business who make hard decisions. Are they facing cost cuts? Are layoffs in the future? What about major investment decisions that could affect everything you do? The leaders where you work need the prayers of those called to intercede for them! They may need you to hold their arms up! Be available to pray. You might just save the day! 

If you’re a leader in your business, you may want to raise up a cessor either as a volunteer position, in your family (spouse or other), or even as an employee. The position is absolutely critical for knowing when icebergs are ahead! They’re also invaluable when your ship is heading toward the Promised Land. You don’t want to veer off course! Cessors provide discernment directly from the Lord. Take a risk and trust God through them! See if it bears fruit. If so, you’ve gained significant insight into the decision-making processes within your organization! 

You may find that your coworkers, some who like you and some who don’t, need to be interceded for. Throughout our years in the corporate world, we’ve had many instances of both. The best example is when two employees of great prominence within the office simply did not like your good buddy, Scott. Both had spoken out their displeasure publicly and with significant emotion. We prayed for both people the same way: we asked the Lord to bless their eyes, ears, and minds so that there wouldn’t be any interference with our communications.

We forgave them and asked the Lord to intervene in their lives. We asked the Lord what covenant to speak life into and then did so. But ultimately, we had to leave them to their choice. We asked the Lord to have mercy on them and give them grace, but if they would not choose to yield from their opposition, that they would be given an invitation to move out of the way of the Kingdom. One person made the wrong choice and ended up leaving the department after decades of service. The other person made the right choice and had a radical change of heart. The last time we saw them, there were tears of gratitude for all that the Lord had done in their lives! 

Who else? It’s important to pray for every vendor and supplier who sells products or services to you. Think of them as having direct access to the backdoor of your business. They’re like a tributary to a river. If any pollution comes through them, it can affect your downstream quality. Ask the Lord to shine His Light upon your suppliers. Each day, ask Him for your portion of revelation in accordance with His will. If He shows you defilement, dismantle it through forgiveness.

Your customers are obvious targets for intercession. Everybody wants to pray for them, but have you ever asked the Lord which customers to sell to? This idea goes against every business model because it’s assumed that customers come through statistical likelihood. The more you prospect, the more hits you receive. But we’re talking about the Kingdom of God! Before calling anyone, what if you asked the Lord whether or not they were right for your company? Every businessperson we know has had at least one customer they wish they hadn’t sold to. If you inquire first, you will always be glad to have those who say yes! 

Sometimes, it’s the decision-maker in the prospective client’s company who needs intercession. If they’re in your field, ask the Lord what their covenant is. Pray for that person! Speak life into their covenant with the Lord. If the Lord indicates you should sell to them, ask Him what freedoms and blessings He wants to give to them through you. Begin to pray into those. Dismantle any discerned deceptions concerning them. Bless the covenants you find! The quality of your sales will rise into the stratosphere! You will keep your customers for as long as the Lord says. If they choose to leave, He can replace them!

Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven.” Matthew 5:44b–45a 

To effectively pray for your customers, you must likewise be willing to pray for your competition. Is it possible the Lord wants a huge prospect, one you would love to do business with, do business with your competitor instead? Could that be His will? It could! If it is, you don’t want to do business with that person, company, or organization. Your competitors have a calling just as you do. The Lord had a plan when He created each owner, leader, employee, and supplier. They can affect the Kingdom, too! 

“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.” Matthew 6:19–20 

Pray for your competitors. Ask the Lord to raise up their cessors to usher them into their destiny! If you’re called to pray for them, ask the Lord what His covenant is for them. Have a heart for the eternal Kingdom’s benefit over what could benefit your company in the short term (within a century). Forgive them if they are dishonest or falsely accuse you. Forgive them if they steal or assassinate your character. Dismantle any demonic strongholds and release God’s covenant for them. Ask the Lord to enrich their vats to be overflowing with the business He’s called them to. You cannot believe the treasure you will store up in Heaven by doing this. 

“I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone—for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.” 1 Timothy 2:1–4 (NIV 1984) 

There are very good reasons for business leaders to intercede for national and local governments. Do their regulations affect how you conduct business? Would a war affect the economy? Do

community leaders affect the way business is done in your town? Do the decisions of trade unions affect your cost of business? Do your creditors affect your cash flow? All these leaders affect how your business sees our Father’s will done. The Lord may reveal that any of these are in your field of harvest. What if our government and community leaders have a destiny in the Lord, and we prayed in that covenant instead of complaining about their condition? Just remember to ask the Lord who and what to pray for. Don’t take on a burden of intercession for anyone outside your field of harvest. 

If you do, you will spiritually clog yourself and shut down intercession at your company. By praying for those you’re called to and learning what God was thinking when He created them (covenant), you can affect the Kingdom for eternity and your business right now. We’re emissaries of Love wherever we go. This must permeate all of our business activities! 

BUSINESS LAND APPLICATION 

“Their fellow Levites [priests] were in charge of the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries for the dedicated things.” 1 Chronicles 26:20 

As we discussed in the chapter, “Priests,” God’s adult sons and daughters who’ve laid down their lives at the Lord’s feet (Rev. 12:11), choose to die to self daily (Luke 9:23–24), and receive daily bread portions of their irrevocable calling (Matt. 6:10–11, Rom. 11:29), have been called kings and priests, a royal priesthood (Rev. 5:10, 1 Pet. 2:9). They are stewards in charge of the treasuries and storehouses the Lord has hidden in the land for “times of war” (Isa. 45:3, Job 28:22). 

“These were the gatekeepers belonging to the camp of the Levites [priests].” 1 Chronicles 9:18b 

Before its destruction in 70 AD, God’s temple was a building made of wood and stone. Now, the temple is in the hearts of God’s people (1 Cor. 3:16). The first temple had gates kept by the priests of the Lord. Jesus is the gate to the Kingdom of Heaven (John 10:7), and because Jesus sent us as His Father sent

Him (John 20:21), we’re now gates! Similarly, there are treasuries and storehouses accessed through spiritual gates on land that the royal priests have been made stewards of. 

Wherever your business is located, it has land the Lord wants you to be a good steward of. Oftentimes, this will be your headquarters, retail outlets, warehouses, and any customer sites where you have equipment or personnel. These may be large in number, so the key is to stay focused on what your field of harvest is and what you’re called to pray for specifically. Identify this with the Lord, and then ask the Lord to raise up cessors for any locations that aren’t in your field.

How can you steward a spiritual gate and its heavenly storehouses from a physical location? Step one is to have designated persons, likely including yourself, who gather to pursue that land’s daily bread of the Father’s will being done. The Lord has a plan for every land and its resources. He wants to release this to the whole world in daily bread portions. The people designated to pursue this endeavor can listen to the Lord’s voice for what He wants to say every day. At first, God may want you to inquire about what He was thinking when He created that land. What is His covenant for it? He may have you speak life into this plan through a prayer session where a significant blessing is released from your business. 

Step two is to ask the Lord to shine His Light to reveal hidden sins requiring prayer and hidden treasures to receive, both in daily portions. Every day, your headquarters and all other locations need to be prayed over. Anything in your life or business that isn’t Love will be revealed safely and over time. When you are pursuing daily bread, this is a very good thing! This might seem like a lot of work, but it’s mandatory for proceeding deeper into the heart of the Lord in this new wineskin.

Follow the same procedures for praying over buildings. Walk over the land and spaces in each building to discern any defilement that might be remembered there. Do this as often as the Lord leads; it’s not mandatory to do every day unless the Lord says so. When the Light of Jesus reveals defilement, forgive the sins of any person the Lord leads you to, hurling

down the accuser with the blood of the Lamb and the word of the person’s testimony. Declare that the memory of the sins is erased. Post angels at the doors as led by the Lord. He will show you the functions that need to be handled by certain angels (sentry, sentinel, warring, guardian, etc.). 

Wherever you or other company employees go, you will need to pray over business trips in the same manner. Always inquire of the Lord before formally committing to travel. If He blesses the trip, remember to pray over your mode of transportation, both there (airplane, bus, car) and after your arrival (rental, taxi, shuttle buses, trains), and any hotel rooms you stay in. Remember that these things could have memories of sin defilements: bloodshed, broken covenant (adultery in hotel rooms), idolatry, or sexual immorality. Ask the Lord to reveal any blessings you can declare to improve the atmosphere of everywhere you go. 

Many, if not most, sons and daughters of God are called into some form of business venture. As owners and employees, we’re called to treat our businesses like we do everything in the Kingdom. Our Father is to be our source in it all. If we freely choose Him as our source, we will see His will accomplished every day as His strategy is fulfilled! We know that His plan is good, beyond what eye has seen, or ear heard, or mind conceived!

KEY 

The Lord wants the Kingdom to expand in every part of our lives. For business owners and employees, this means living the same Kingdom life at work as we do at home. By pursuing daily bread portions of His will done and yielding our business roles and functions to God, we’re storing up eternal treasures in Heaven for everyone in the Kingdom.

Chapter Twelve

Revival 

“The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai: ‘Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before Me.’ But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish [Spain].” Jonah 1:1–3a 

Jonah didn’t see it coming. He was a Hebrew man of God, raised in his forefathers’ traditions. When Jonah was young, he dreamed of becoming a servant in the house of the Lord. He thought that one day, he might become a rabbi or prophet. He saw himself ministering to the people, teaching them God’s word, and showing them His goodness. 

Needless to say, when the Lord called him to preach in Nineveh, Jonah was shocked. In his day (760 BC), it was unheard of for a Hebrew to preach to Gentiles! Jonah’s expectations didn’t align with the Lord’s calling, destiny, and design for him. Because of this, he ran away. 

Jonah’s plan was to serve a portion of the Hebrew people. This was a good plan. God’s plan for Jonah was to lead 100,000 families (500,000 people) to Yahweh’s love through repentance. This was the best plan! Later in life, Jonah became a prophet to King Jeroboam II of Israel, restoring the boundaries of Israel from Lebo Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah in accordance with

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p> 
{ #p129}


---

the word of the Lord (2 Kings 14:25). God’s plan was so far beyond what Jonah expected that it’s astounding! Jonah would have to trust Him to see it through. 

“[Jesus] answered, ‘A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.’” Matthew 12:39 

A revival has begun in our day but not just any. It’s the greatest one the world has ever seen! All creation has been groaning for it. God’s sons and daughters have been offered the commission, power, and authority to complete Jesus’ mission of hurling down the accuser and preparing the Bride. This is the generation that seeks His face, the one that Jesus cried out for. It does not love its life so much as to shrink from death. It’s made of those who’ve given away their plan for their lives and yielded to the will of the Father in daily portions. This generation will live out what eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor mind conceived.

Among revivals throughout history, we feel to highlight a couple in particular. We believe the one occurring now is the third in a series. The first was the Welsh Revival of 1904. That was a Jesus revival, a revival of Passover. Many people came to know the Lord and received the promise of eternal life through belief in Jesus Christ. The second revival was Azusa Street, which began in 1906. That revival was founded in the Holy Spirit and was based upon Pentecost. From that one mighty move of God, an entire century of growth took place in the Body of Christ. The Lord brought healing back to the Church. There was freedom, deliverance, and inheritance that came to many. The supernatural ways of God were embraced, albeit slowly. 

The present third revival is built upon the previous two but is completely different. This is a Father’s revival, and as Jesus said, no sign will be given but the sign of Jonah. Many people are expecting it to be a move of the Holy Spirit that will look like Azusa Street. The Holy Spirit will move, but the revival will be much different. Like Jonah before us, the sons and daughters of God will be held in a safe and loving womb (Jonah’s whale) until we’re birthed (released upon dry land) into our irrevocable calling. It’s not a revival of Passover or Pentecost but of intimacy.

FEAST OF TABERNACLES 

“‘This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come; celebrate it in the seventh month. Live in booths [tabernacles] for seven days: All native-born Israelites are to live in booths so your descendants will know that I had the Israelites live in booths when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.’” Leviticus 23:41b–43 (NIV 1984) 

The third revival is a family revival. In it, fathers and mothers will be given a spiritual womb with which to raise their spiritual children in relationship. Sons and daughters will come to this safe and loving place where they are nurtured and developed. There will be healing, deliverance, and freedom for all. 

Kingdom boundaries will be set for children so they can learn behavior that aligns with the righteousness they’re seeking. When the boundaries of Love are crossed, the sons and daughters will hold themselves accountable and confess their sins. Because those involved are healed and being healed, and have yielded their lives to God, it will be a safe and loving relationship. 

The spiritual children will receive revelation of their gifts. They will be given opportunities to practice using these gifts. They will have the freedom to make mistakes in an environment where the damage is minimized. Their confidence will grow as their skills develop. As they proceed deeper and deeper into the Father’s heart, they’ll begin to receive pieces of their calling and destiny. Soon, they will become masters of their ministry and will be ready to leave the nest. 

It’s mandatory that the children in this revival grow up with the freedom to actually leave the nest. For too long, God’s children have been like baby birds waiting for momma to bring them food with their mouths open. The point was always for them to learn how to fly, soar, find what they need, feed themselves, and then teach others how to do the same. We’re only given a short time in this life. We must learn to love God, ourselves, and our family. They need us so desperately!

DAY OF ATONEMENT 

“‘This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month you must deny yourselves and not do any work—whether native-born or an alien living among you— because on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you. Then, before the Lord, you will be clean from all your sins. It is a sabbath of rest, and you must deny yourselves; it is a lasting ordinance. The priest who is anointed and ordained to succeed his father as high priest is to make atonement. He is to put on the sacred linen garments and make atonement for the Most Holy Place, for the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and for the priests and all the people of the community.’” Leviticus 16:29–33 (NIV 1984) 

This third revival is identified with the fullness of atonement. In this move, God’s sons and daughters are finally given the “keys to the sports car.” The Lord had to wait till we were old enough to drive with maturity and handle the responsibility. He couldn’t give the keys to a six-year-old. He didn’t want us to hurt ourselves or others. He didn’t want us to crash the car! Once we reached maturity, He could release the full commission, authority, and power to hurl down the accuser with the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. 

In this revival, God’s sons and daughters are kings and priests. We’ve been called to serve the Lord and His Temple, which is our brothers and sisters. Like the early priests, we prepare people, places, and things for the Presence of the Lord. This is similar to how the Levites prepared the holy places, the altar, and the Israelites. We’ve been called to bring atonement for all the priests and people in our communities through forgiveness. Equally, by forgiving those whose sins have granted evil a legal right, we purify polluted places or things. We’re called to carry Jesus’ blood and sprinkle it throughout creation to set people, places, and things free so all can be released into their destiny. 

MISSING IN ACTION

We have continued in the wake of the Azusa Street revival for a century. In the last twenty years, we have witnessed a strange occurrence that needs to be addressed. In our travels, we noticed

that there are many wives and single women who are active in Kingdom work but not as many husbands or single men. This phenomenon has become extremely problematic, as the fruit is an out-of-balance condition in the Church. As the Azusa Street revival progressed, we saw a move of the Holy Spirit in physical manifestations, words of knowledge, increased discernment, and intimacy with God that many men did not understand or felt left out of. 

The Lord created women to be strong in discernment. This isn’t to say that men do not discern; they do, but women are especially anointed for moving in the Holy Spirit that way. The first half of the Azusa Street revival was designed by God to reintroduce supernatural occurrences, especially with healing. God designed the revival’s latter half to move the Church toward deeper intimacy with the Lord and the discerning of our own spirits. The backfire was when some men couldn’t relate and therefore withdrew due to disinterest or intimidation. 

The Lord created men to have a strength in receiving revelation. That isn’t to say that women don’t receive revelation; they do, but men are especially anointed for receiving it from the Father. Because of this, there’s good news for us all! The third revival is from the Father! This in no way makes it exclusive to men. Simply, in the beginning of this revival, God is drawing men back into their roles to participate in the Church. The Lord wants to see the Church balanced and moving in the fullness of His design. He has always primarily intended for men to receive His vision of design and for women to receive the application of that design through discernment. 

The enemy would lie and indicate that one strength is better than the other and, therefore, create a sense of superiority or inferiority between the two genders. This is not the case, and we do not receive this lie of the enemy! The Lord creates His children to work together in unity as a Body for the purpose of His will done. God is good, and His plans are good. We celebrate the restoration of our family back to unity, where God commands a blessing (Ps. 133). Together, we will become a big ship designed through revelation that turns on a dime through discernment. We will change the world!

GLORIFIED BEINGS

“For those God foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified.” Romans 8:29–30 

The Lord created us to become those who love Him and those who are loved by Him. He formed our spirits within Him when He stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth (Zech. 12:1). He spoke to us about His plans for creation at the beginning when we were by His side as appointed craftsmen (Job 38:21, Prov. 8:23,30). Long before He created our souls and placed them in our mother’s womb (Gen. 2:7, Ps. 139:13), He showed our spirits His plan. It was a big risk. We would come to the world as humans with minds that wouldn’t remember any of these things. We would be raised in a world with tangible senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, but we wouldn’t recognize our Creator in any of these alone. Would we prevail? Would we discern, beyond the limits of our bodies, the Truth that is before us? Would we overcome the temptations of false love that only brings pleasure or comfort and instead choose eternal, true Love? 

“For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.” Luke 2:30–32 (NIV 1984) 

Creation is designed around our choice of Love or not-Love. Its purpose is to bring fire to us, like a hammer and anvil with mighty blows from God, to mold us into His glorified lover. God intended us to be worthy of this through a lifetime of freely choosing covenant with Yeshua Ha’Mashiach, Jesus Christ. Within this covenant are four covenants: our rescue into becoming His servants, our promotion into intimacy to become His friends, our abandonment to trust to be His children, and our perseverance through selflessness while being His Bride. 

We must navigate the demand God’s people have for a supernatural sign and wonder that broadcasts the “start” of this revival. Jesus called the generation who demands a sign “wicked and adulterous.” Similarly, demons began providing signs early

in history as they visited people and won their allegiance through supernatural manifestations. The hunger for supernatural power has led many people to fall into the deception of trading sins of defilement to get it. That desire polluted many Hebrews and Gentiles alike with seeds of evil that grew into deep-rooted doubt. 

“ . . . on this rock [of revelation] I will build My church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.” Matthew 16:18 

Though many are uncertain, the Kingdom of God is built upon revelation and faith. God is supernatural, but Love is seen clearly when we choose Him freely and without proof. If God revealed Himself to us fully, what would happen to our choice? How could we possibly choose selfishness if we saw the actual power of God? Many would comply out of fear instead of intimately knowing Love! The Lord hid Himself so we could freely choose Him without interference. 

Our life in Christ was always meant to be twofold: His blood and our spoken testimony. Together, these hurl down the accuser but not without our choice of Love. Jesus saves us, but overcoming requires a daily choice. According to Revelation 2 and 3: Those who overcome will have the right to eat from the Tree of Life. We won’t be hurt at all by the second death. We will receive some of the hidden manna. We will receive authority over the nations and will rule them with an iron scepter. We will be worthy to be dressed in white. We will be pillars in the Temple of God. We will be given the right to sit with Jesus on His throne, just as He was given the right to sit on His Father’s throne. We will become glorified beings worthy of being the lover of God. 

KEY The third and final revival has begun on the earth, but it doesn’t look like what most people are expecting. God’s sons and daughters are being given an impartation of anointing to grow up in a safe and loving womb, where they will master their gifts and calling. Spiritual fathers and mothers are called to nurture and develop these children and then release them to go and do all the Lord created them to. This fulfillment of destiny will result in the greatest harvest the world has ever seen.

Chapter Thirteen

Betrothal

“Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If
anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will
come in and eat with that person, and they with
me. To the one who is victorious, I will give the
right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was
victorious and sat down with my Father on his
throne.” Revelation 3:20

The generation that lives today and has witnessed the birth of the
adulthood of the church is represented by the letter to the angel
of the church in Laodicea. This generation within the church has
been raised with a belief in Jesus through the religion of
Christianity. Many people claim to belong to Him and are not
cold, but they do not have a relationship directly with Him and
so are not hot either. They still love their lives too much and
would shrink from death. Jesus calls this generation “poor,
naked, and blind.” What they need is gold, white clothes, and
salve. They need the discipline of God to be restored to their
predestined glory.

Jesus is inviting this generation to join the adult sons and
daughters of God by laying down their self-lives so they can
have our Father’s life in them. He is calling them to put on the
white clothes of righteousness. This requires that they stop
preserving their owns lives by covenanting with wounded parts
of their souls, and instead stand in the Light

where these wounds can be identified and healed by the Lamb’s blood and the word of their testimony. Jesus is inviting us all into a final covenant before the wedding: the covenant of betrothal.

COVENANT 

“Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you! See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are ever before Me.” Isaiah 49:15–16 

Throughout the Bible, our Father describes His covenants with us using hands, feet, and ribs. Upon each is a cut to signify the covenant between us. He engraved His people on the palms of His hands. Adam’s side was cut to remove the rib that God formed Eve with. Circumcision is a cut. Jesus was cut in three locations on His body: hands, feet, and ribs. 

“But when they came to Jesus and found that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.” John 19:33–34 

The cut on Jesus’ side is the most significant one in terms of our betrothal with Him. Just as Adam was cut on his side to remove a rib for his covenant with Eve, so Jesus was cut when He was crucified. This cut of covenant is when the marriage proposal to us was originally given. From that day forward, Jesus stood at the door and knocked for His Bride to answer and let Him in. The dowry has already been paid. 

Our Father says, “I will if you will” in covenant, meaning that He commits to do what He says, and if we accept, we will do what He calls us to. The kingdom of selfishness mimics this with the defilement of bloodshed, including sacrifices. Additionally, the enemy’s plan for splintering people was to cut (like an engraving) on our souls to create a covenant with him. Satan’s method is to mimic Love to build the kingdom of not-Love. 

In Hebrew times, the tefakh (H2947), which represents the width of the hand, was the smallest unit of measurement and symbolic of covenant. The pictorial depiction of tefakh is a triangle. The

</p> 
{ #p138}

combined triangles of the hands of man with the hand of God in covenant create a symbol we call the “Star of David.” We lift our hands up to meet God’s. When we bring our hands back down, we have something in them we can give away. 

“Every place where you set your foot will be yours.” Deuteronomy 11:24a 

Abraham had a covenant for land. The Israelites painted this picture as they walked through the Promised Land with the soles of their feet. David had a covenant for an everlasting kingdom. Solomon’s real temple was not the building made of stone but the chuppah he made for the Shulamite he loved. All of these had one thing in common: if we’re good stewards of honoring our covenants with the Lord, we will be fruitful.

“The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance.” Psalm 16:6 

Our “boundary lines” are what God has promised us by covenant. These are the span of our tent pegs, which are extended further and further as we go deeper and deeper into the heart of God. The Lord promises us our identity, gifts, and calling and His blessing, favor, and love. All of these priceless, eternal promises come from within the covenants of the Lord. He is always good and always faithful. 

We have previously outlined four covenants in Hebrew that mirror our lives in Christ today. They are Servant, Friend, Inheritance, and Betrothal. In a Hebrew marriage, these covenants were represented by four cups of wine that were shared among the families of the bride and groom. The first came when the groom and his father knocked on the door of the prospective bride’s family. The door was only answered if she said yes. When the door was answered, the whole family drank from the first cup. The second cup was drunk at the start of the negotiation meeting by the fathers, the groom, and the bride. This symbolized the friendship between the families. 

The third cup was only between the bride and groom, but unlike the other two, it was consumed at the end of the meeting, after the agreement was fully adopted. At that point, the couple was

legally married. In regards to the present-day adult sons and daughters of God, we’re corporately at the end of the Inheritance Covenant, ready to drink the third cup. We’re living in the process of receiving daily bread of our Father’s will being done. It’s time for us to become legally betrothed. After that, the final step is becoming one flesh.

JERUSALEM 

“As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds His people both now and forevermore.” Psalm 125:2 

Before Jesus can become one flesh with His Bride, the Bride must become one. He will only marry the sons and daughters of God and not slaves. He will not marry a child, only a mature adult. The Bride must grow up into maturity and the fullness of age to become eligible for marriage with Jesus. Equally, He isn’t looking to marry thousands, millions, or even billions of individuals but to marry one unified Bride. 

“One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, ‘Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.’ And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.” Revelation 21:9–10 

The adult sons and daughters of God have pre-qualified for this moment. They converted from slaves of sin to servants of God, from servants to friends, and from friends to His children. They have matured into the fullness of age and are ready for marriage. The final step is when they all yield to God, patiently submitting to daily bread portions of the Father’s will done. When they do this, the Lord will mold them as a potter forms clay into the shape they were designed to have. They will fit together perfectly, a feat that cannot be accomplished without the work of our Father.

TAKING HIS NAME 

“Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in Me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these,

because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in My name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” John 14:12–13 

The name of Jesus represents great power, and all of creation responds to it. Even the demons bow to His name. Yet when we use it as fuel to make things happen in the spirit realm, for our will to be done instead of the Father’s, we have misused His name. The right to carry the name of Jesus had significance in the early Church. Many people were baptized in the name of Jesus as an outward sign of an inward decision.

“Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon- possessed. They would say, ‘In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.’ Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. One day the evil spirit answered them, ‘Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?’ Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.” Acts 19:13–16 

Those who use the name of Jesus without being in the Betrothal Covenant won’t be known. They’re using His name for purposes not intended by God. Jesus has reserved His name for those who are called to become His Bride and are married to Him by covenant, even though the wedding hasn’t occurred yet. Only those in this covenant will be called by His name and will sit at the table and eat with Him. 

“He built altars in the temple of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, ‘My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever.’” 2 Chronicles 33:4 

WEDDING 

“‘Let us rejoice and be glad and give Him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His bride has made herself ready. Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear.’ (Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the saints.)” Revelation 19:7–8 (NIV 1984)

Immediately after the fall of Babylon, depicted in Revelation 17 and 18, the Lamb’s wedding occurs. At that time, the Bride has made herself ready; she produces righteous fruit by only doing what she sees her Father doing, just as Jesus before her. She yields to God. She lays down her self-life to receive God’s life for her. She doesn’t love her life so much as to shrink from death. When the time comes, the Bride is holy and pure. She is prepared for the consummation of her wedding! “I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice He judges and wages war. His eyes are like blazing fire, and on His head are many crowns. He has a name written on Him that no one knows but He Himself. He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and His name is the Word of God. The armies of heaven were following Him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean. Coming out of His mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. ‘He will rule them with an iron scepter.’ He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. On His robe and on His thigh He has this name written: King of kings and Lord of lords.” Revelation 19:11–16 Three verses after the wedding, we have a rider who isn’t recognized by John as being Jesus, although there are characteristics of Him in the description. The rider is called “Faithful and True.” His name is the Word of God, and the name “King of kings and Lord of lords” is written on His robe and thigh. There are also characteristics of the “son of man,” who is the saints. The rider judges, has many crowns, and will rule with an iron scepter. This rider is the newly-wedded Lamb of God, who has become one flesh with the saints of the Most High! 

KEY 

Jesus stands at our door and knocks, willing for anyone to accept His marriage proposal, but they must first become God’s adult children through the Inheritance Covenant. All sons and daughters who then enter the Betrothal Covenant will become one flesh as the Holy City of Jerusalem. This happens as we yield to daily bread of our Father’s will done. Finally, on our wedding day, we will become one with Jesus!

Chapter Fourteen 

Dress Rehearsal 

“The Lord said to Moses, ‘Speak to the Israelites and say to them: “These are My appointed feasts, the appointed feasts of the Lord, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies.”’” Leviticus 23:1–2 (NIV 1984) 

Twelve years ago, our family began a journey of homeschooling. At the time, we were simply obeying Pappa. We knew it would drastically change our lives in very practical ways. Rooms and closets would have to be rearranged to make room for curriculum and supplies. Schedules would have to change to accommodate teaching, naps, and running the household. It was a bit daunting, but knowing that what Pappa enacts He enables, we dove in. 

The first year of homeschooling passed, and let’s just say we survived and pressed on, knowing it was His plan. That summer, Pappa sent reinforcements in the form of a group of friends who decided to homeschool as well. We formed a co-op with other families and excitedly began year two. That was when we realized the journey we’d been invited to was not so much about rearranging rooms but rearranging us. It started with a simple decision by a group of moms that was the igniter of something way bigger than us. I don’t know where the rest of the families have come out all these years later; I can only tell you that it turned the lives of Scott, our family, and me upside down and

inside out. It was a Kingdom ambush of such magnitude, though we wouldn’t realize how big the impact would be until much later. 

We moms decided to have a Passover Seder to introduce the kids to the feasts. I would love to tell you that the Seder was incredibly intimate for us all. Actually, it was somewhat chaotic, and we felt lucky to get through all the spilled salt water and grape juice with minimal damage and the lesson somewhat intact. The mission we had was accomplished, but the true assignment was just beginning. 

I was pierced with the thought that there was more. The idea that something so precious had been left out of everything I had learned about God rattled around inside my heart and rumbled through my spirit. Then, suddenly, my spirit was ignited. It had a rendezvous, an appointment with Pappa to remember something woven into it from the beginning. Ironically, the reminder was that we were created for rendezvous, appointments with Him. This wasn’t strange to me, as I had standing appointments with Him every day, 24/7 appointments. (I probably shouldn’t monopolize Him like that, but it’s kind of addictive!) In these times, I worship Him, feast on daily bread, thank Him, sync heartbeats, and we share our deepest “every-things” with each other.

Yet I knew He was talking about something more, way more. Something was stirring that wasn’t just for me as a person but for a people, a peculiar people who would come together and become a generation. There was a generation who, together, would fulfill a destiny established from the foundations. But when the fulfillment would occur was in question because it required a choice that went as deep as it does wide. From this choice, a people would be birthed to become the generation Jesus cried out for and all of Heaven eagerly awaits.

The first leg of my journey to explore these appointments was in the Old Testament. Though an obvious choice, it was an utter ambush. Honestly, after participating in the longstanding, annual “read through your Bible in a year” contest hosted by my dad, I avoided reading the Old Testament, well—like a plague. I could never connect or get through all the begats and begetting.

Fortunately, I had a very intimate relationship with Jesus from the moment He spoke to me on a mountaintop as a little girl. I was in love with Him from the first whisper, helplessly, hopelessly in love. 

God as Father was a bit hard for me. I had trouble finding Him. He seemed distant and a bit intimidating. My biological father was absent, thus the perception of distance. My dad, who grafted me into his family, was an amazing man, but it was hard for him to share his heart. As I grew, so did he, and I’m so blessed I had such a man as my dad. But the damage was largely done by then, and God was “the Judge.” Sadly, in many ways, that’s how He was presented and modeled to me. 

As a girl, when I was caught doing something I shouldn’t have been—yes, caught; I know I should have just confessed—I received my “earthly punishment” and then was told to await the one I would receive from God. The Smiter was after me, and I remembered the Scripture about how long His arm was. I was never going to get away with anything, so I tried to stay away from Him. Pleasing Him was said to be largely impossible. And, after one too many messages about what would happen if we left church and were hit by a bus, I wasn’t so sure that I could meet His requirements. Truly, I could never figure out what those requirements were. I didn’t feel quite safe and was pretty sure I would be “kicked out” of the whole thing upon the discovery of my next shenanigan.

Poor Pappa! We’re always told He doesn’t give us more than we can bear, but I don’t think we consider that we often try to give Him more than He should have to. But there we were. Eventually, we came to a place of peace together, but He was after more than peace. Way more! He wasn’t going to relent until I remembered who He really was. He wasn’t going to be satisfied until I was filled with a consuming passion to tell others. 

Coming back to our rendezvous, we stood at the gate of the Old Testament. I wanted to hold His hand, but He wanted me to gaze upon His face so I could see His heart. His idea was much better. I thought we would dive into Leviticus, and I braced myself. It

felt a bit more like walking the plank, but walk it I did, and I fell right into His heart. From that position, all I could do was look up, and that is where He reminded me of things long forgotten. 

LIGHT AND DARKNESS

“And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day. And God said, ‘Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.’ And it was so.” Genesis 1:13–15 

It all came flooding back. Every moment under the stars and how I always felt like they were made just for me. The song I heard them sing was indescribable. The memory came like an explosion that devastated me to anything but the fullness of Him. I remembered trips to the observatory and how I would frustrate my teachers. As we looked upon the constellations, I always felt like something was missing. I didn’t talk much, being shy, but these questions wouldn’t stop: “Where are the rest of the pictures?” “How do the pictures fit together?” “Why aren’t they teaching us about their voices?” Writing this now, I realize I probably didn’t frustrate my teachers as much as totally freak them out! The answer to my questions was always the same: “This is all there is. There isn’t more meaning.” 

These moments led to me writing Objects In Mirror are Closer than They Appear, a teaching on redeeming all the things Pappa created that were perverted by the enemy. In it were things the Church had become afraid of because we’d forgotten the fullness of our inheritance. These were the very things that, if redeemed, would lead many into their covenant instead of a distorted version. 

When I read Genesis 1:13–15 on the day of my rendezvous with Pappa, I was just peeking over the precipice. Reading those two verses was like walking in a candy store. Each piece was a morsel for my spirit to savor and delight in. They introduced me to the God I had missed but desperately wanted to discover. As I unwrapped each delicacy, I realized every piece was unique and

delicious, and became more so when I enjoyed the next one. Together, they filled me up and brought a satisfaction I had never experienced. 

The revelation that I had only been entering into a part, or segments, of covenant stunned me. Today, I’d even say my covenant was splintered! Though I knew Jesus as my great love and the Holy Spirit as the precious voice of Heaven, they were parts of a Whole. I was missing the piece of Pappa! I hadn’t even begun to taste the richness of them together. I hadn’t entered into the fullness of the covenant I’d been invited to because I’d missed the One who created it, who engraved it on my palm. I was undone as I realized the immensity of His heart. He was the creator of Love itself. Well, He is Love itself. Love is because He is. Whew! 

This God I discovered willingly separated Himself so that we could discover Love in the fullness it was meant to be! On the third day, light was separated from darkness. Whoa! What a picture for us of how He separated Himself so we could step into our destiny as reconcilers for the Kingdom. We’re called to reconcile the world to Love (Him), but we can’t do that if we aren’t reconciled to the fullness of Him ourselves. 

“I will betroth you to Me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion.” Hosea 2:19 

Considering the separation of light and dark set off mini glory bombs inside me. Each explosion brought a revelation of something separated, groaning to be made whole again. Creation was groaning to be made complete, to be made love. 

Love isn’t a feeling. It’s a destiny. It’s a covenant we’re invited to complete. It’s hesed (H2617), in Hebrew, a love that is promised and meant to be completed. Pappa promises it and invites us to complete it. 

Pappa sent a part of Himself in Jesus to bring reconciliation to the earth, to all of creation. If we’re commissioned to do all Jesus did, it’s time to step into the destiny of deepening the cross, meaning, we release the inheritance purchased through that utterly selfless act. I should say selfless acts, as Pappa also acted

selflessly by separating Himself. Jesus then separated Himself from Heaven to fill the darkness with Light, and He’s released us to do the same. Why is this separation of light and dark important? Light and dark were part of a whole! It’s a model of completing covenant. 

“Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.” Genesis 1:2–4

It doesn’t say darkness was bad. But until God created light, there was a void ‘emptiness’ called bohuw, (H922). In creating light and separating the two, He established a covenant to be fulfilled. The darkness was meant to be filled with something: light. Until it is, there’s a hunger, a groan to be filled with what it was created for. Darkness is completed when it receives the light. 

He separated the two so we can see, so we can choose. He did this for love. It began in the garden. Adam and Eve lived in the light of the ‘day’ (H3117), yom, which means yesterday, today and tomorrow; it means eternal. They were to be a picture for us of what it looked like to dwell with Him. All creation was good, and they were free to partake of all the trees, save one, for there was a shadow in the Garden. A shadow is an image cast by an object and represents its form. 

That shadow was the one tree that they were asked to not bite of. It was a picture of what would happen if light was intercepted. It was a picture of what would happen if Love was intercepted. An outline of another plan was seen, and Adam and Eve chose not- Love. The order was reversed. Darkness became dominant through the choice of mankind, and creation became desperate for the order to be restored. It groans still for the covenant to be restored. For if light fills the darkness, all things grow, and hidden things are discovered. 

Darkness has a purpose. The word ‘night,’ as used in Genesis 1, means “protective shadow” (H3915). It’s meant to be a place we glimpse into and discover hidden things. It’s a place we see things yet to come. In the shadow, we can spot the outline of the

enemy’s traps (Ps. 91:3, 1 Tim. 3:7), anything that might take us by surprise (Amos 3:5, Obad. 1:7) or keep us from what’s meant to be found. When light is intercepted, we aren’t meant to be blinded but to see something hidden. When we thwart the interception of Light so hidden things are revealed fully, we fill the void with Love, and order is returned. Light becomes dominant, and it changes everything, including our body and the Body. 

“The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.” Matthew 6:22 

As a people, we cry out to see many things. Why would we have a groan to see? Because our eyes have become weak. Our eyes see a shadow instead of a reality. We put many names to what we want to see: glory, healing, and promises fulfilled. Yet, there is something far greater we ache for: the promise that one day, there will be no more nights.

“There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.” Revelation 22:5 

We cry out for a moment, but it should be for a destination. A destination is a place one is going or being sent. It’s the ultimate purpose of what something is created for. Our destination is to live in the day where we will reign with Him forever. How do we arrive there? How do we fulfill the covenant we were created for? We simply RSVP to an ancient invitation issued by Pappa. Go back to Genesis 1:13–15 with me for a moment. There are more delicacies to partake of: 

“And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day. And God said, ‘Let there be lights [illumination] in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs [desire, distinguishing mark, banner, remembrance or proof] to mark seasons [appointment, prearranged meeting, sacred season, appointed feast of the Lord] and days [yesterday, today and tomorrow, a cycle that reveals each other] and years

[age or lifetime], and let them be [a light] in the expanse of the sky to give light [to be or become light, as in the light of day, to shine, to be illuminated, to kindle] on the earth.’ And it was so [upright, established, true].” Genesis 1:13–15 

Please forgive me if that was laborious, but it was so important. I love the many meanings of the one word ‘light.’ Pappa is so deep! In this verse, He is inviting us to dive in. Let me paraphrase it now with the depth of its meaning. He said: 

“Let the day and night be illuminated so you don’t lose your way. I have put My banner of love upon the heavens. I have put My desire for you there. I have done this so you will remember and have confirmation of My love. I have put them there so you will know when we can meet and rehearse for our wedding day. I’m inviting you to do this so you remember that I am the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow in My love for you. I ask you to do this all your life so a desire will be kindled upon the earth in My people, and many will feast. If you do, others will remember and be made ready. I have put this in place. It is My truth, My covenant with you.” 

Who could resist such an invitation? Sadly, many have. Not just a few people but entire generations. 

“Hear what the Lord says to you, people of Israel. This is what the Lord says: ‘Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the heavens, though the nations are terrified by them. For the practices of the peoples are worthless; they cut a tree out of the forest, and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel. They adorn it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter.’” Jeremiah 10:1–4 

This story sounds so familiar, a people who are terrified of God. Generation after generation terrified of Love? It breaks me to think of it. The Israelites were afraid to see His face. The servants in the parable of the talents were afraid of their master. The Pharisees and Sadducees were afraid of people’s relationship with Jesus, and there was the boiling point.

In Jeremiah, the Lord asked the Israelites not to be terrified of the signs in the Heavens. He told them if they went the way of the nations, they would get lost (as they did in the wilderness). They’d once again miss the opportunity to truly know Him and would turn to other gods. In doing so, they’d choose to make Him the shadow, and the gods of the world around them became their reality. Isn’t it interesting how a tree was highlighted in the verse just as in the garden? They would partake of a tree instead of meeting with Him. 

Pappa so longs to give to us. In Leviticus 26:1–13 He even lists rewards for meeting with Him at these appointed times. There are amazing things such as rain, planting and threshing overlapping, fruitfulness, and freedom from enemies. Wow! But the best one: “I will walk among you. I will be your God, and you will be My people.” However, when our eyes are weak because we’ll only look for a shadow of Him, we reap the reward below: 

“‘Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit. The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. Last of all, he sent his son to them. “They will respect my son,” he said. But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, “This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.” So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?’ ‘He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,’ they replied, ‘and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.’ Jesus said to them, ‘Have you never read in the Scriptures: “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes”? Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.’” Matthew 21:33–44

What a painful description of missing Pappa’s invitation. He won’t settle for a generation that doesn’t truly know Him. There is something critical to glean here. The servants didn’t treat the vineyard as their own, though they’d been given responsibility for it. While they didn’t treat the vineyard as their own, they definitely treated the fruit as theirs. They couldn’t see that the owner was giving them an inheritance. Instead of receiving what was freely given, they killed another so they could “live.” 

Pappa is looking for those who will be stewards of the vineyard, ones who will give the first fruits of the harvest. Those who give Him fruits in their seasons understand those seasons. They understand that in following each cycle and season, they become better at planting and harvesting each year. They gain a deeper understanding, and it becomes a tangible, visible picture of how things come from the inside out. 

The generation He seeks yields. They can rest as seeds die and then begin to grow; they themselves are willing to fall upon the Rock to be broken and crushed, to lay their lives down so what’s in the soil can produce great fruit for the harvest. At feast time, they have much to celebrate and much to give! 

The first tenants stumbled because they lost their way in the dark. They began to see what was good as evil and what was evil as good. They sought to hold on to what they had and missed the gift the landowner offered them. The landowner knew the blessing that was theirs when he freely gave them the first fruits, but they saw it as something being taken from them. If you aren’t willing to give, then you do have much to lose. 

The generations to date have lost much in this same manner. Precious invitations have been tossed aside in an effort to abolish what is meant to be fulfilled. Pappa invited us to timely meetings from the beginning of creation, but we’ve become dismayed by the signs because we can only see them as losing something instead of gaining everything. We live in the shadow of a tree. We’ve let that shadow become our reality. We think we live in the light of day, but we’re really walking in a reversal.

We have celebrated a shadow of Him and called it fullness. In doing so, we stop short of our destination. How? Why? We don’t understand our destiny as reconcilers. We don’t understand that what Jesus did, we will do. He went to the cross and brought reconciliation. He commissioned us to do everything He did and greater. He left an inheritance for us, one meant to be used, not hoarded. We have an inheritance from which we’re invited to give a first fruit. 

To reconcile something means to take what is good (light) to fill the void (darkness) so they can become whole. There are many things we’re called to bring to wholeness. One that we have largely avoided is our history and our future: the Old and New Testaments. The beginning and the end are meant to be a complete work. We’ve just allowed the purpose of some three- letter words to be lost in translation:

“Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: ‘The man who does these things will live by them.’ But the righteousness that is by faith says: ‘Do not say in your heart, “Who will ascend into heaven?” (that is, to bring Christ down) or “Who will descend into the deep?” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).’” Romans 10:4–7 (NIV 1984)

The Greek word ‘end’ here is telos (G5056). Telos means “an end to which all things purpose.” It also means “destination” (a place one is going or being sent to or the ultimate purpose something is created for). Our previous understanding was that to end means “to stop or do away with.” In the Western church, we often look for our origins in Rome, Athens, or even the Welsh Revival and Azusa Street, but our beginnings are found in shadow (a place of protection) that was filled with Light so we could see. A shadow should cause us to turn toward the Light that has been filtered, and it allows us to see a glimpse. 

What we’ve discerned for so long is that there was a void in the Old Testament. That doesn’t mean Pappa left something out. It means He intended to bring Light to it so all could see more

fully, so it could be fulfilled. To ‘fulfill’ means “to carry to the end, bring truth [Light] to, to accomplish that for which something was intended.” 

The first five books of the Torah were written as a marriage covenant. Jesus came as the Light of the world so we could see the covenant. He came to fulfill the covenant and make it come true. He brought reality and substance to the promise. He came to be the Groom. 

“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.” Matthew 5:17–20 

These are the words of Jesus. He was saying, “I didn’t come to do away with. I came to fulfill. I am Light to these things, so the purpose for which they were written will not be void. And the end will not be until every letter is fulfilled.” 

This brings us to the second three-letter word we don’t understand very well: ‘law.’ Law is torah in Hebrew. It comes from the root yarah (H3384), which means “to shoot out the hand to show or indicate, to teach or instruct.” It means “to lay the foundation.” Yarah begins with the letter yod, which is the smallest letter in Hebrew. The numerical value of yod is ten, which indicates completion (we have ten fingers and ten toes because of that). The pictorial form of yod looks like an open hand raised to Heaven, and hands represents covenant. 

I hope that wasn’t too cumbersome. All that to say, ‘law’ means “to guide, instruct, and show the way.” It means a hand is extended for us to take so that we might enter into the covenant offered and walk together to the end, to fulfillment. It’s Pappa’s

help or grace. His grace, which is His favor and mercy that brings gratitude, led to the Law, and His hand extended to us so we could choose intimacy.

Whew, what a lover Pappa is. He wants us to get to the “end.” He wants us to celebrate our salvation as we move to the fulfillment of all we were created for. There’s more that we’re being prepared for. There’s a wedding, we are the Bride, and long ago, Pappa invited us to the dress rehearsals. We have a standing invite to the Mikrah Kodesh, a holy assembly, which in this case, is a full, uninterrupted dress rehearsal, or the last rehearsal given by the Groom’s family. The wedding is the main attraction, of course, but the rehearsal of appointed times matters. Since we don’t know when the last rehearsal is, He invited us to do them in a cycle each year, for a lifetime, so that we would be ready. 

FEASTS OF THE LORD 

I love dress rehearsals. Throughout our years of homeschooling, we attended many dress rehearsals for the opera, ballet, and symphony. In them, there is such excitement and expectancy. There is no doubt in the minds of those performing that the final performance will take place. Even though the rehearsal isn’t the final performance, it’s done as if it is. In fact, we’ve never been to a dress rehearsal for one of these presentations that was interrupted. 

I remember one such rehearsal. The director came out to introduce the troupe. She said, “Welcome to the dress rehearsal. We act this out tonight for the purpose of revealing.” She didn’t say what they were revealing. I remember being wrecked when she said it because it was the best description for the rehearsal of the feasts I’d ever heard. My spirit screamed, “Yes!! We perform the feasts to reveal more of Him!”

The feasts are an incredible expression to the world of who Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and Pappa really are. In the Old Testament, they are an early rendering. When something is rendered, it’s condensed or made into a picture. To render something can mean “to submit it for consideration.” In its verb

form it means to cause to become. It is something meant to be a
snapshot so someone responds and explores it or opens it up to
fullness.
Pesach (Passover), Unleavened Bread, First Fruits, Shavuot /
Festival of Weeks (Pentecost), Trumpets, Atonement and Sukkot
(Tabernacles) are called the Feasts of the Lord. They were
established by God, unlike our holidays, which were established
by man. Four of these feasts occur in the spring and three in the
fall. Seven festivals in two seasons. I love numbers (as long as I
don’t have to use them for math). Actually, Pappa does too as
He created the alephbet with numerical meaning as well as a
pictorial significance.
There are seven feasts. Seven is the number of maturity or
perfection. Its pictograph is a sword and represents the cutting
up of time (or seasons). As we have talked about, when things
are separated, each can be seen more clearly in order to complete

the picture they make together. There are four feasts in the
spring season. Four is dalet or gate, so the four spring feasts are
a gateway to the three fall feasts. The feasts occur within two
seasons. Two (Bet) signifies covenant. Its pictorial meaning is a
house or dwelling. This represents our covenant to dwell with
Him forever, which we rehearse at the last feast, Tabernacles.
Unleavened Bread, Shavout and Tabernacles are the three feasts
that the Lord declared as pilgrimages.
“Three times a year all your men must appear before the LORD
your God at the place he will choose: at the Festival of
Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks and the Festival of
Tabernacles. No one should appear before the LORD emptyhanded:
Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way
the LORD your God has blessed you.” Deuteronomy 16:16-17
Not one thing Pappa established was insignificant. He asked the
men and their families to take a journey. Lying in wait for them
were robbers, who knew that the people carried treasures to give
as offerings. They greatly desired these hidden treasures. The
travelers learned that if they banded together and each one
carried a weapon, the robbers would let them pass by, because

they knew the group was too strong for them. Wowzer! That is a walkthrough of unity commanding a blessing (Ps. 133:1–3). What a testimony for us. When we unify, travel together, and walk in our gifts, the enemy cannot steal our hidden treasures. 



Another important detail in this invitation: the Lord asked them to journey three times together in this way. Three is such an important number. Its Hebrew name is gimmel. As you can see in the image above, it looks like a person walking. This visual represents a rich man running after a poor man to give him charity or a blessing. It also symbolizes our pursuit of God and His invitations. As the three pilgrimages were a time of offering, the root word gamal means “to deal out, indicating either blessing or justice for the one who gives.” The Lord isn’t interested in meaningless sacrifices but willing offerings (remember the story of the vineyard). 

Three also represents stability. When we make these three festive pilgrimages in our hearts, we come to three major encounters with Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Knowing the fullness of the Trinity brings stability. It’s like meat for our bones. This is the beauty of the Lord separating Himself for us so we could see His fullness with clarity. 

Gimmel is also the first letter in ‘kinsman-redeemer’ (go’el, Lev. 25:26, Ruth 3:9). As we journey, we have many opportunities to pursue our kinsmen with the glorious gift of redemption. When we do, we offer them a yod (hand), a letter whose shape (י) you can see in the picture of gimmel. The other portion of gimmel is a sword (ז, zayin, seven). Together, yod and zayin represent the perfection of justice. We offer an open hand of covenant and mercy with a sheathed sword in the other, representing the justice that comes if the covenant is not accepted. However, we use the sword to separate Light from dark so people can see. Justice is for the restoration to Love! Justice is Pappa’s intervention to rescue us from not-Love! Mercy and justice walk hand in hand!

The last thing I want to highlight in the pictorial of gimmel is the crown on its head. The points are such a distinct reminder of who we’re created to be. He sends us as kings and priests to pursue our kinsmen, our brothers and sisters. Gimmel represents commissioned people running forth in pursuit of those who haven’t gotten to choose Truth yet. We are a royal priesthood called to go across the earth loving and forgiving. What great charity that is. 

We’re invited numerous times in the Old and New Testament (Deut. 11:19; Eph. 6:4) to remember, teach, and repeat these festive rehearsals. We’re instructed to remember the Law, the covenant for which we were created. If Jesus had truly come to abolish the Law, the feasts would have simply become a memorial. But Jesus not only honored them, He celebrated them! In fact, every redemptive act of His life occurred upon a feast. We will go more deeply into that as we continue, but keeping the feasts mattered to Christ. 

Many of us know Jesus spoke in a way that caused those around Him (and us today) to go deeper and explore. His very life and death were for that purpose—to deepen our understanding of everything by bringing Light to all. As I’m led to Scripture, it brings me great joy to find within the words treasures I’ve yet to discover. I’ve been immersed in Pappa’s heart to receive all I need to prepare a feast for you. I hope this banquet will cause you to desire to dive headfirst into a chamber of His heart few have explored. This longing of my heart has become my food and drink for some time. As I swam inside Him, He surprised and even ambushed me when He took me to these words of Jesus: 

“No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come. It’s like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch. Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back—whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn. If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping. What I say to you, I say to everyone: ‘Watch!’” Mark 13:32–37 (NIV 1984)

Our Beloved instructed us three times to watch. The Hebrew word for ‘watch’ is shamar (H8104) and means “to have charge of, keep guard, protect, save, celebrate, and persevere.” Isn’t it interesting that Jesus said to “watch” three times, considering there are three pilgrimages? He said it once for each of them. Each represents a time of remembrance for the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He also stated that we don’t know the hour, so watch and rehearse until the hour comes. Three strands (Eccl. 4:12) come together when we receive, remember, and reveal the fullness.

“For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. Immediately after the distress of those days ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.” Matthew 24:27–30

Jesus tells of a time when the rehearsal will be done. Oh, the day that the most beautiful sign appears in the sky, and we will celebrate together. What a day that will be! Now to the rehearsals! The goal in this is not to give you every in and out of the feasts. There are amazing resources that can guide you on how to celebrate a Seder meal or build a sukkah booth (plural: sukkot). My favorite books on the subject are The Feasts of the Lord by Kevin Howard and Marvin Rosenthal, Celebrating the Biblical Feasts In Your Home or Church by Martha Zimmerman, and A Prophetic Calendar: The Feasts of Israel by Jill Shannon. Our destination in the following pages is to understand what they mean to the heart of Pappa and Jesus.

PESACH (PASSOVER) 

Passover was so significant to Pappa that He instructed that priests be assigned to make sure it was not forgotten. The first Passover occurred at the time of the tenth plague of Egypt, which would bring the death of the firstborn children. God’s people

were instructed to sprinkle their doorposts with the blood of a spotless lamb, and they would be passed over and their firstborn spared. What an incredible God! They weren’t just being spared something; they were given something. From that moment, their doorpost became a memorial to God and His salvation. The act was an agreement to come under His protection and let Him cross over the threshold of their home and fill it with Himself. It was the establishment of a covenant. 

As with every feast, this was a shadow of what was to come. Every year, as the Israelites celebrated Passover, they were reminded of the promise of a lamb that would be slain for them and bring them salvation. Pappa pierced their threshold in anticipation of the One who would pierce their hearts. And so, they rehearsed for that day. They rehearse still, though the Lamb has come, for their eyes are weak from gazing at a shadow instead of looking into the Light that has come. 

The day of the true Lamb did come. The Israelites were instructed in Exodus 12:46 to not break the bones of the Passover lamb they sacrificed each year. According to that word, no bone was broken in the body of our Savior. Remember, every jot and tittle will be fulfilled. Just as Pappa opened the doors of the homes of His people, stable doors were left open as the sacrificial lambs were slain, so their cries could be heard. Christ was crucified and bled on the doorpost of the cross, in the open, where His cry to Pappa could be heard. Just as the Passover lambs were being set aside for sacrifice on the tenth day of Nisan, Jesus entered Jerusalem as the Lamb of God. 

Christ was nailed to the cross at the same time the lambs were being prepared for the offering at the temple, and He died the same time the lambs were being slain. The Gospels specifically detail the timeline (John 12:12–13, Mark 15:25). This is such a picture of prophecy being understood in its season of fulfillment. Fulfillment came, and Pappa worked out every detail because He didn’t want anyone to miss it. How His heart must have broken when they did! Prophecy was manifested in their midst, but their eyes were weak.

Many would say that because Jesus came, the prophecy is complete, and the feast does not need to be remembered. Yet every heart has not been pierced as His body was on the cross. The open threshold has not been leapt through (as is the custom in Hebrew homes) by so many. As we rehearse this feast, we bring reality to the invitation and reveal more of who He is. 

MATZOT (UNLEAVENED BREAD) 

This seven-day feast begins the night after Passover and celebrates the deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt (Leviticus 23:6). It was also a time of repentance and the putting away of sin. When leaven (yeast) is placed in a lump of flour, it will grow and spread until it permeates the whole lump. 

“A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.” Galatians 5:9

Part of the observance of this feast is the search for leaven or yeast. A piece of yeast is hidden in a bag in the house. The generations of the family come together, light a candle, and search for the yeast. I love this picture of the hidden things being revealed in the Light! The next morning, they burn the bag of yeast, just as the lambs were burned in sacrifice and our sins burned away when Jesus was sacrificed for us. All bread made during this feast is without yeast, and no yeast is eaten for the full seven days. Not only does it represent freedom from slavery, but also, the grain must be crushed to become flour, just as Jesus was crushed as seed to become our salvation. The Feast of Unleavened Bread is a remembrance of freedom, for how can man own those who belong to God. This remembrance is a celebration of the Light that reveals the hidden things keeping us from fullness, and all the hidden treasures, too. 

RE’SHIYTH (FIRST FRUITS) Re’shiyth

(Deut. 26:10) occurs the day after Matzot (Unleavened Bread). On this day, we’re called by our Father to wave an offering of our first fruits to Him (Lev. 23:12). Jesus died on Passover and was resurrected the day after First Fruits, which is three (gimmel) days, or seventy-two hours later. Our traditional

celebration called Easter, which is from Friday to Sunday, doesn’t account for this. In truth, there was a full seventy-two hours between death and resurrection. This was foreshadowed with Lazarus. Jesus knew His culture, as did those around Him. They knew that three days was the allotment made in death for completion. That’s why Jesus wouldn’t resurrect Lazarus before that amount of time had passed, raising him on the fourth day. It was a rehearsal for what He would walk through. If Jesus had been resurrected before three days, there would have been questions as to the validity of His death. 

“‘Do not hold on to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to My brothers and tell them, “I am ascending to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.”’” John 20:17b

Only observing Good Friday to Easter Sunday doesn’t allow the fullness of the picture for those who need to see. It mattered that He was raised right after First Fruits because He was our first fruit, our offering. These first offerings couldn’t be touched until they were given, when the offering was complete. Jesus walked out every detail so all things could be deepened and made real. This celebration encourages us to not stop short of all He planned for us. When we walk faithfully as our Savior did, we become a first fruit to many.

“But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. But each in turn: Christ, the first-fruits; then, when He comes, those who belong to Him. Then the end will come, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.” 1 Corinthians 15:20–23

SHAVUOT (FEAST OF WEEKS) 

Shavuot began as a celebration of harvest. There are exactly seven weeks (fifty days) from Passover to Shavuot. Seven (zayin) means maturing or perfecting, and so these weeks were a time of great anticipation. The ground was pregnant with wheat and would soon give birth. During this festival, the story of Ruth

is read. Her story takes all that was a rendering and explodes it into a rich tapestry. Each of the Four Covenants is modeled in Love and Truth. She and Boaz’s story is a prototype for us as we walk our own journey. 

After ten years, Ruth’s husband died. Her mother-in-law Naomi wanted to travel to Moab because she’d heard stories of God visiting the people there with bread. Naomi released both her daughter-in-laws, Ruth and Orpah, to go back to their homes. Orpah accepted her release, but Ruth became hesed (loyal) love to Naomi and refused to leave. 

Ruth entered into covenant with Naomi’s God and became a servant. She gleaned provision for her and Naomi daily in the fields. She was then befriended by Boaz, who told his workers to leave the corners of the field for Ruth to harvest from. In the story, Ruth had already modeled the Servant and Friend Covenants, and she understood that it was important to walk each step of her journey. Though Boaz was kind to her, she first had to be a daughter to Naomi before she could become a bride to any other. There was a covenant to fulfill to make sure Naomi would have generations to rise up and call her blessed. 

Ruth stepped into her inheritance as a daughter so she could be prepared to become a bride. When it was time, Naomi released her to be a bride. Ruth could accept this gift of inheritance because of how faithfully she had walked each step. When it was time to go to Boaz, we were told that Ruth rested. She knew the one to whom she was sent would settle the matter. In lying at Boaz’s feet, she was declaring he had a right to her. She knew all he had was hers, and she was submitting all she had, her very life, to him. By asking him to spread his cloak over her, she invited his covering to be over her. Boaz took his place as her kinsman-redeemer, and they were married. Everything concerning her was taken care of. A covenant was fulfilled. 

Though Ruth is read as a harvest story for the celebration of Shavuot, we cannot miss the treasures within the story. The example of covenant is glorious. One of the most beautiful parts of the feasts is that we’re asked to give them for those who can’t pay us back. Boaz gave a daily feast for Ruth, though she had no way to compensate him. Then there is the part of the story that

comes up several times: daily bread! Naomi wanted to go to the land where manna fell daily, and Ruth gleaned daily for the provision God had for her family. 

Shavuot is truly a celebration of the forty days the Israelites spent in the wilderness receiving God’s provision for them. God was in their midst, providing for them as He led them to rest. It was an illustration that there was bread coming from Heaven they couldn’t make for themselves. Without that bread, they would die. Jesus illustrated this Himself when He multiplied the fish and loaves. The people couldn’t obtain for themselves what He supplied. Then He became the seed that was crushed and sifted to make bread that would satisfy the way no earthly bread could. 

The prophets called the desert a time of true romance. This is another part of what we can celebrate as we rehearse Shavuot. The Israelites were in the desert for forty years on their journey to the Promised Land and rest. The number forty (mem, מ) represents a womb. The Feast of Weeks is not only a time of anticipating what will be birthed but also a time of nurturing what is growing. Just as farmers must water and weed what is growing on the earth, we’re called to nurture or steward what we’re being trusted with. 

Noah and his family were in the ark for forty days. They said yes to an invitation breathed from the Spirit of God and became pregnant with an adventure that became a restoration. At the end of a different set of forty days, the Israelite spies returned from Canaan. Ten of them gave a testimony of fear. But two (bet, the number of covenant) returned and gave birth to the idea that there was a dwelling place for the people and it was worth not loving there lives unto death. Moses spent forty days on a mountaintop after hearing the Ruach (breath) of God and became pregnant with the idea that he could encounter the Presence of God and become unrecognizable. 

There was risk involved for each of these. They had to be willing to do something crazy: die. They had to be willing to give up their lives so something amazing could grow. Mary was such a stellar example of this. The Spirit of God came to her, and she became pregnant with a destiny that was so much bigger than

her. For forty weeks, she had to die to herself, her ideas, and plans. She faced persecution and accusations. As each day went by, her very frame decreased so the frame of God could increase.

By the end of the forty weeks, He was the biggest part of her. Because of her yes, God became flesh in Jesus who walked His image out for us. Upon His baptism, Jesus received the Holy Spirit. Immediately, He was sent to the wilderness for forty days. As the pregnancy of His commission came to fullness, fire came in the form of satan. He tested and tried Jesus, and Jesus died before He died physically. Fire was put to His flesh as a beautiful offering to His Father, and He was sanctified. All that Pappa created Him for was made complete in the fire. He lived out His words:

“The reason My Father loves Me is that I lay down My life—only to take it up again. No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from My Father.” John 10:17–18 

The people in each of these stories had to go through the fire to sanctify themselves to be pure, to carry the part of Heaven they were trusted with. As it was for them, so it was for the disciples. Their sweet Lord had died. This wasn’t looking like they thought it was going to. It probably felt as if they had died, too. Then the first fruit was waved, and Jesus came to them. They were now able to touch Him, even the covenant holes within Him, since He had been offered to the Father. As they talked with Him, He gave them a gift. He breathed upon them and gave them the Holy Spirit.

“And with that He breathed on them and said, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit.’” John 20:22 

Weeks before Pentecost, He gave the disciples their commission and everything needed to fulfill it. For forty days after the impartation, He came to them and nurtured what He had impregnated them with: a calling, a commission, and a Church. He reminded them that death was necessary for what was in them to grow. They must die so that He could live in them!

“After His suffering, He showed Himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that He was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the Kingdom of God.” Acts 1:3 

And then, for ten days, they went into the upper room to pray. That was a test for sure. They’d received the commission and empowerment, and now they had to endure a little longer to birth all that was in them. Anyone who has gone one day over their due date can relate to this. But their test would become a testimony. What they received would be released to a world in need.

“The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ. John answered them all, ‘I baptize you with water. But one more powerful than I will come, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and to gather the wheat into His barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.’ And with many other words John exhorted the people and preached the good news to them.” Luke 3:15–18 (NIV 1984) 

The wind began to blow and fire fell. The words of John must have filled their ears. Even if they did recall what he’d said, they were stunned. The Holy Spirit came, and so too a fire that burned away flesh. The commission they received was sanctified and purified in a flame that would allow nothing but Him to remain. They had been commissioned for so much. They were asked to love fiercely. The reality of that destiny came right away:

“While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said, ‘Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.’ So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.” Acts 10:44–48

In an instant, the prophecy of Jeremiah 31:31–34 was realized. And it wasn’t just for those circumcised physically. All who received the Sprit became circumcised in their hearts, and a Church was born. Shavuot teaches us how to receive power and walk in it daily. 

“A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man’s praise is not from men, but from God.” Romans 2:28–29 (NIV 1984) 

“I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.” Ezekiel 36:26 

This is such a huge part of the celebration of Shavuot. Two loaves of bread are waved to represent the Jews and Gentiles who will one day be made whole, one new man (Eph. 2:11–16). Shavuot is the celebration of two parts coming together to form one covenant. Wow! Interestingly, as you research Shavuot, you will find few elements listed to celebrate, but it’s the biggest section of the feasts! It is all part of opening up the rendering to fullness as Jesus came to do. 

The last aspect I will share is one of the highlights usually found when researching this festival, but believe me when I tell you that this part grew as it rumbled inside me. One way Shavuot is celebrated is to stay up all night and read the Torah (the Law). This is done as a commemoration of the giving of the Torah. With our new understanding of the word ‘law,’ that is worth celebrating, for it’s the anniversary of the giving of covenant. It is a time to hold our hands up in praise for the extending of His hand to us. Many celebrate by eating ice cream, as it’s said that the word of God is like milk and honey. 

Still today, people stay up all night and read the Torah and pray for Shavuot. This observance reminds us that we’re to stay awake. Jesus asked us to remain alert, to be awake. This was important to Him, but we’ve seen time and again that it’s

difficult even for those who walk closely with Him. The disciples fell asleep at the Mount of Transfiguration and almost missed His glory. They fell asleep in the Garden of Gethsemane and almost missed His destiny. Hmm. Maybe one of the “signs of Jonah” is being asleep at a critical moment (Matt. 12:39).

Like His Father, Jesus left nothing to chance. He so wanted us to understand that He gave the disciples a dress rehearsal on a boat: a storm came up, and Jesus slept peacefully. This is a great lesson on resting in storms, but He was showing them something more. He was revealing that one day, He would be “asleep” (physically gone from them), and they must be awake to do what He had done and greater. Actually, the boat was more of a run- through than a dress rehearsal. A run-through has many stops, starts, and corrections. Modifications are made before the dress rehearsal so it runs smoothly. They got a practice for the practice. He is so gracious! 

ROSH HASHANAH (FEAST OF TRUMPETS) 

Rosh Hashanah is proof of how desperately Pappa wants us to make it to the wedding. Though Shavuot teaches us to stay awake, the Feast of Trumpets takes care of matters if we aren’t. When the shofar blasts, we will have the choice of joining in with our voice or being startled awake. I certainly don’t want to be startled by His return but anticipate it with a full lamp! The shape of the shofar represents the human heart bowed in submission and repentance. 

Rosh Hashanah begins the new year and moves us from month six (Elul) to number seven (Tishri), so it’s a time of maturing and perfecting. Six in the Hebrew aleph-bet represents man and the hook that held the curtains of the tabernacle together. There is a ten-day period between Trumpets and Yom Kippur. Ten represents completion, so this is a time of our refining as we prepare to enter the tabernacle to dwell with the Lord. It’s a time of worship as we let go of all things that hinder, just as David did when he worshipped between every sixth and seventh step while bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem (2 Sam. 6:13).

To me, Rosh Hashanah also represents a time of pregnancy, as forty represents a womb, and the end of that many years in the desert is part of the celebration of Sukkot. The people came out of their temporary dwelling and into their “permanent” dwelling of the Promised Land, their land of rest. 

A beautiful pictorial in this feast is when families gather together and cast stones into a river. Each stone represents a sin that is being removed from our lives. Casting them into the river is a symbol of Jeremiah 31:34, where the Lord says He will remember our sins no more. Whoot! 

YOM KIPPUR

This feast is also known as the Day of Atonement. This is the day that Aaron stood and sprinkled the blood of animals and forgave the sins of Israel. It is the shadow for us of who we are as royal priests, sprinkling the blood of Jesus, loving and forgiving those who have fallen short of God’s glory as commissioned in John 21. 

SUKKOT (FEASTS OF TABERNACLES / BOOTHS)

Tabernacles is the rehearsal for our ultimate destination: the wedding feast and resting in our dwelling place with our Groom. We’re reminded to rest in Him and not what we’re building: 

“By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.” Hebrews 11:8–10 

What we build is temporary, but what He builds is eternal. On a recent journey to Cyprus, we were reminded of this. We hiked three miles to a castle that was built to defend people. However, there was a flaw in the building. Instead of protecting them, it became a trap. All they could do was watch as their enemies approached by land and sea. All of their efforts were in vain, as

they trusted themselves for protection in establishing a dwelling. As we approached, Pappa said, “Whenever man tries to build a temple to Me out of wood and stone, it becomes a temple to himself.” 

Jesus dwells in us. We are His temple, and we journey to the day that we tabernacle with Him. This truth is so amazing in light of the knowledge that Jesus was born during Tabernacles. Many scholars say the time of Jesus’ actual birth isn’t known. But Scripture paints a much different picture. Luke 1 tells the story of the conception of John the Baptist. It states that he was conceived after Zechariah’s service in the temple. I won’t go into it fully, but here’s a bit of info if you would like to research for yourself. Consider this as homework: 1 Chronicles 24:1–19, 1 Chronicles 9:25, and 2 Chronicles 23:8 detail the division of the twenty-four grandsons of Aaron.

All that to say, Luke 1:8 evidences that John would have been conceived at Tammuz. We’re told that Elizabeth gave birth to him at his time or the fullness of pregnancy (Luke 1:57). This would make his birth at Nisan or Passover. Luke 1:24–27 and 36 tells us that Jesus was conceived six months after John. This would make Jesus’ birth during Tabernacles. Also note that Bethlehem would not normally have been so crowded. The reason the census time was chosen was that most families were making the pilgrimage to their towns of origin for Tabernacles. This is why there was no room in the inn. 

Don’t you love that Jesus was born in a stable in a feeding trough? He is our bread from Heaven, after all. Recently, Idg pointed out another significant point to me. Lambs are born in stables, whoa!

The fact that family gathered together during this feast is so important to understand. They came together in their sukkah and shared life together. A fruit of the season is grapes, a beautiful cluster that is a picture of who we are to be together, united on one branch. Remember the fruit that Joshua and Caleb brought from Canaan? Grapes! When we come together in unity, we will find rest in the land of promise.

Whether you want to delve into the possibility of Jesus being born at Tabernacles or not, several significant things happened with Him during those appointed times. It was during Tabernacles that Mary and Joseph couldn’t find Him. When they did, He was in the temple, His Father’s house. 

At His last Feast of Tabernacles, He declared two glorious things. The first was, “I am the Light of the world.” Tabernacles is the time of the lighting of the temple! The second:

“On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, ‘If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.’ By this He meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.” John 7:37–39

Isn’t it amazing how both light and rain are needed for things to grow so they may bear fruit for harvest? At the end of Tabernacles, the Water Gate of the temple would be opened. At this time, the people would pray for rain. They would ask that there would not be drought during the upcoming planting seasons. Jesus addressed the drought in people’s hearts when He invited them to come to Him and drink.

“For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out My Spirit on your offspring, and My blessing on your descendants.” Isaiah 44:3 

SHABBAT

Though the command to remember the Sabbath is fourth in our Bibles, it’s the first command in the Torah. God told Moses He had a precious gift He wanted to give the people. This gift was called intimacy, the opportunity to meet face-to-face. They wouldn’t receive the gift, so in His grace, He extended His hand (gave the Law) so He could direct them to the place of intimacy. 

We have taken “remember the Sabbath” to mean go to church on Sunday. But that was not what He was thinking when He created Shabbat. This is especially interesting when considering that

Shabbat begins at sundown on Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday. This isn’t to say you have to observe Shabbat then. I know many people who celebrate on different days, as it works with their family schedule. The point I make is that He wasn’t saying to go to church. He was saying, “be the Church.” He invited us to feed each other and take part in each other’s lives. 

“Then He said to them, ‘The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.’” Mark 2:27

This says that Sabbath was a gift for man to enjoy. Every week, as we prepare for Shabbat, I remember this invitation. I see it as an opportunity to say yes to that original invitation to intimacy. To me, it’s a weekly candlelight dinner with Him and the treasures of my heart: family.

We have talked about the feasts as dress rehearsals. I see Shabbat as a rest rehearsal. The Pharisees perverted rest by making observing the Sabbath a list of requirements. Just as the Church has often changed or developed holidays to fit its needs, the Pharisees went beyond what Pappa said and put their own requirements in place, extending the rod (a meaning of the word ‘law’ that isn’t applicable in the case of the Torah), instead of the hand of covenant.

“For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings.” Hosea 6:6

Pappa desires to be known, to be seen. He wants to be found. There is no place better than a table prepared for a feast with candles lighting the way to hidden things. Shabbat is filled with amazing symbols of who He is and who we are. I feel like Shabbat incorporates parts of all the other feasts, so we get to rehearse every week. At the beginning of the feast, the mother of the household lights two candles (bet, two is covenant). Just as Mary welcomed the Light of the world to the earth, the mother welcomes the Light into the home. The two candles represent creation and redemption. One means “remember” and the other “observe” or “keep.” When the candles are blown out, it represents the darkness that came when Jesus died. It also represents the darkness that many still live in.

Hands are washed to show sanctification and dedication of the covenant. Wine is served in an overflowing cup to show the fullness of the week. This act leads to the celebration of all He poured out that week. In Hebrew culture, they would drink from the cup with fingers up to show longing for Him. Two loaves of challah bread are served, a picture of two parts becoming whole and a celebration of all that has come together. They are dipped in salt to show what has been made. This oneness can’t be separated again, just as it was impossible for Hebrew men to separate the salt they mixed together in covenant. 

It is also a remembrance of how Pappa gave two days of manna on the morning of Shabbat. Once sundown came, it was time for rest. Even our sweet Pappa rested, just as He did on the seventh day. Rest doesn’t mean to do nothing; it means to enjoy the fullness of what has been accomplished. The braid made in challah bread symbolizes arms folded in rest. Ahhh! Ecclesiastes 9:17 tells us to eat our bread with joy. Shabbat is an amazing time to do that. There is much joy at a table where family rests in the goodness of who Pappa is and what He’s done. 

As Shabbat is celebrated, we are reminded of the Four Covenants we journey through, and we remember they represent the chambers of His heart. We drink wine as a commemoration of the Servant Covenant. Bread is dipped in salt as a remembrance of the Friendship Covenant. We wash our hands to signify the Inheritance Covenant. Finally, we fill the covenant cup to overflowing to celebrate the upcoming Cup of Praise we will drink together in the Betrothal Covenant.

In Hebrew, rest means “fullness of, security, to deposit, lay down, or depart from.” In Exodus 33:14, we are told His Presence brings rest. Psalm 95:7–11 says unbelief leads away from rest. Hebrews 4:4 says only those who believe can enter His rest. Joshua 11:23 speaks of rest from war, and Joshua 21:44 talks about rest on every side. 1 Kings 8:56 says rest was given to the people. 1 Chronicles 22:9 prophesied that Jesus would be a man of rest. Isaiah 32:17–18 declared that His people would dwell in rest. Matthew 11:28–30 says Jesus would give us rest. Colossians 2:2 speaks of a mind at rest, and Psalm 62:1 tells of rest in God. This is my Shabbat “restipe” (get it?). I hope you liked it!

Rest is a gift and promise. It is a destination He longs to lead us to. It is the blessing of the Promised Land that is our inheritance. Though, not all who are invited will say yes: 

“So, as the Holy Spirit says: ‘Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the wilderness, where your ancestors tested and tried Me, though for forty years they saw what I did. That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, “Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known My ways.” So I declared an oath in My anger, “They shall never enter My rest.”’” Hebrews 3:7–11 (Numbers 14:28–35) 

Our Pappa is a lover. He separated Himself in pursuit of us. When we come together and sing at the wedding feast, He will be reconciled. Our Pappa prepares us to be given away to a beautifully glorious Groom. That Groom will present us to Pappa and all will become one. He knew we would have a hard time being dressed and ready, so from the foundations of the earth, He established signs for seasons, dress rehearsals to reveal, and shadows for turning. Read below what happens with those who don’t rehearse: 

“Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. Then he sent some more servants and said, “Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.” But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his business. The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. Then he said to his servants, “The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.” So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. “Friend,” he asked, “how did you get in here without wedding clothes?” The man

was speechless. Then the king told the attendants, “Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” For many are invited, but few are chosen.’” Matthew 22:1–14

The servants were those who never pursued past the Blood Covenant. Their destiny was to invite others and serve at the wedding. The king called the man who came without wedding clothes “friend.” A friend has moved beyond but not into the fullness of covenant they’ve been invited to. He didn’t have on his wedding garment, so he was easily identified as one who had chosen to stay right where he was in relationship. And so, his hands and feet (covenant) were bound, and he could go no further. Those who were called by the servants had been invited because it was their inheritance, but they weren’t ready. Their reality had shifted. Maybe they stood in the shadow of a tree. Day had become night, and they couldn’t see. Their lamps must have been out of oil. They didn’t come when called, and they each will be startled when the trumpet blows. Startled awake. Awake! Arise! Watch! 

A FAMILY AFFAIR 

Celebrating the feasts has become one of the most enriching, intimate endeavors our family has embarked upon. Together, we have walked toward a deeper knowledge of God, Jesus, the Spirit, and the Kingdom. 

These rehearsals have become so precious and personal to us. We are often asked to share how we celebrate. We love to do that with the hope it can be a springboard for others embarking on the journey. What we do is by no means a formula. It is for each person, family, and ministry to discover the treasures of the feasts and apply them in their lives, homes, and beyond. The celebrations are meant to reveal more of Him, so our expressions of the feasts change from year to year as our understanding deepens. 

For the start of Passover, Unleavened Bread, and First Fruits, we host a Seder. Seder means “order” and celebrates not only the journey of the Israelites to freedom but also the divine order in which God does everything. For us, we are reminded of the

extended hand of God to guide and direct us. He leaves nothing out. We see this time as a Valentine’s Day of sorts (without pagan influence), as Passover is the introduction of Love. We do have an incredible meal, complete with lamb. The kids love it. 

During Unleavened Bread, we love going through the house by candlelight to discover the “hidden sin” (the yeast). We hide treasures as well so our children always have the understanding of how good daily bread is and that it’s worth removing hindrances so treasures can be revealed and released. We remove all yeast from the house. This has always been interesting, as you wouldn’t imagine how many things have yeast that don’t seem like they would. It’s an amazing picture of how easily we receive the things of the world as normal because they are so prevalent. 

As we then enter First Fruits, throughout the week, we seek ways to give first fruits to each other. It’s an awesome thing to see your children excitedly finding ways to surprise and bless each other and how it invades life well beyond the celebration of the feast. We also do a weeklong Daniel fast. There have been many laughable moments along the way, such as Connor’s attempt to have chocolate included since it grows on a plant. We have never actually given in on this, but he tries every year! 

We spend the weeks between First Fruits and Shavuot pouring into each other regarding destiny and what each of us is pregnant with. This has become a favorite time for Scott and me to “rest in” for our kids. We focus on who they are and what God trusts them with. Just as Jesus spent forty days teaching the disciples and what He placed within them grew, we teach our children. It’s a time of learning about the altar and it always seems that Pappa gives them an opportunity to lay down their lives for each other. 

The kids host an ice cream party, choosing the flavors and all the fixings for it. I always see this as the wonderful meal after childbirth. It always tastes like the best meal of your life. After a time of intensity of pregnancy and labor, it’s like honey! Before the ice cream, we eat a rich communion meal to celebrate our True Bread. We use two loaves of bread waving them as an offering.

We recount the story of Ruth, and each year, find a new treasure within it. This is such a great picture of daily bread. Shavuot is a celebration of the reality that He has more for us to walk in. The discovery of new treasures in a familiar story is a glorious example of this. As a family, we forgive all those who have entered into a false version of Pentecost. We wash those who have sought the blessings instead of the One who blesses. We forgive any who’ve tried to tap into realms of the spirit, which are our inheritance, without entering into covenant with the Lord.

For Rosh Hashanah, we blow the shofar in the morning as a wake-up call. It is fun to see who is already up and who gets startled awake. We make a trip to the river, and there, we cast our stones over the waterfall. It gives us a vivid picture of how our sins are remembered no more and moved as far from us as the east is from the west. 

After we return home, we get out our Joshua Basket (Josh. 4:4–7). In this basket, we keep stones and a journal. They are a reflection of our daily bread pursuit as a family. The journal details the things God trusted us to pray for throughout the year. Each rock is numbered for one of the prayers. The stones become alive with the testimonies of His goodness. That way, we celebrate not only the testimonies but also how each one caused us to draw near to Him and hear His voice. Giving the kids opportunities to rest in and hear Him, dialog with Him, has been so important to us. There is an epidemic in the Body of being unable to hear the voice of God. We want the kids to have a foundation of hearing His voice and knowing He hears theirs. 

For Yom Kippur, we fast and repent, and as royal priests, forgive all that He highlights to us. The forgiveness becomes very empowered as the kids first repent. We wash our hands so we can wash the feet of others. We are all purified, redeemed, and restored back to God by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimonies. The accuser is hurled down. 

Tabernacles (Sukkot) is our favorite time of year. We haven’t gotten quite brave enough to build a sukkah outside yet. We build one in our living room with PVC pipe and fabric panels. We completely close in our couch. We decorate the sukkah with

lights and fruit, and we fill it with candles, pillows, and journals. Every day, we invite someone to join us for worship, dessert, and celebration. We snuggle up together and celebrate the birth of Jesus. We actually do play Christmas music throughout the week and watch the Nativity Story and other favorites. As a family, we open the Water Gate and pray for a shower of Love for even the hardest hearts (of course, forgiving those whose hearts are turned away from Him). 

Shabbat is our favorite day of the week. We get the house ready for special guests, which is us and any others Pappa has with us! It is a family day. We get everything ready for our Shabbat meals. This is not only our Friday night meal, but we try to prepare ahead for the end-of-Shabbat meal Saturday evening. We meal plan and have simple things for breakfast and lunch and something yummy cooking in the crock-pot throughout Shabbat. As the aroma fills the house, we are reminded of His goodness and provision for us. 

Our Friday night meal is called “community service” because, as she has done with many other things, Allison named it that. When she was younger, she tried to remember “communion,” but it came out “community service.” This has been amusing when we’ve been out somewhere and one of the kids asks if it’s “community service day.” We’ve gotten some interesting looks! 

Our meal partially consists of bread. We don’t always make challah; actually, we only do that for special occasions. Instead, we make a simple flatbread. We fill the table with dips and sauces, grapes, cheeses, smoked salmon, and Mom’s famous (in our house anyway) chocolate chip cookies. Before we eat, the two candles are lit (though we light candles all throughout the house) for our candlelight dinner with the King! At the end-of- Shabbat meal the next day, we light the braided candle, which symbolizes the redemption of creation, the two becoming one. 

We always have more family with us than our eight, but we try to keep it to only the amount that fits in our dining room. We do this unless the kids have friends over for the evening. We’ve seen that whenever there are events meant to draw family together, kids can easily get relegated to a “kids table.” Bringing the generations together is so important to us, as well as the kids

knowing they sit at the family table. We celebrate all the testimonies that have come that week, and they are testimonies the entire family has been part of. The celebration should include the whole family as well. 

Okay, I know you’re wondering (probably because the last holiday season, we received numerous emails asking): what do we do about Easter and Christmas? Our personal celebration of Christ’s death and resurrection is at Passover. It’s become too beautiful of a time for us to consider anything else. The kids honestly don’t think anything about not doing Easter. They were younger when we stopped celebrating it, so it is pretty normal for them. They often get invited to egg hunts and parties with friends, and we give them the freedom to go do that.

Christmas has been a journey. Each year, we’ve scaled it down as our celebration of Tabernacles grew. When we began building the sukkah and decorating it, for a time, the kids lost interest in having a tree, but we do have a celebration during that season; it just looks different. 

Mary conceived the gift of Jesus around Chanukah (Kislev), which also means our traditional holiday season, so we celebrate that the Light has come. We celebrate all the yeses that have been said to allow destiny to be born and Heaven brought to Earth. We look for any places we haven’t said yes. We’ve chosen to gift our children during this time with one gift. These gifts are destiny gifts. They are something that reflects who each of them are created to be and helps them on the journey. Just as Jesus grew in Mary’s womb, the kids are growing. Actually, who He created them to be is growing, and the things not of Him are decreasing in us all. We celebrate the biggest destiny ever conceived: Jesus and the huge destinies conceived for our family! 

KEY 

Our Father has given us appointed feasts that are times to meet with Him and hear the Love story of our own wedding. They are dress rehearsals that prepare us for becoming the Bride of the Lamb.

Chapter Fifteen 

Marriage 

“Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.” Genesis 2:24 

In the beginning, our Father took a lump of clay from His heart to make the known universe and everything in it. From that lump, He took smaller parts off to make each of us. A few months ago, the Lord showed me a vision of Him taking this clay from His heart and forming me with it. The clay that became “Scott” seemed big to me, not in height but around the back and the side. Then I saw Him take half of that clay from me, and with it, He formed Shari. 

Flash forward thousands of years into the future. Many humans made freewill choices resulting in various marriages, some in accordance with the will of the Father and some not. The human bodies and souls birthed from those unions were a reflection of the choices each person had made, but the spirits were untouched because they came directly from the Lord, not from the choices of man. From all of these humans, the Lord picked four people, two couples, from which to birth Shari and me. He placed me in the state of Virginia and Shari in Kansas. 

Our Father knew our choices before we made them, and without interfering with our freedom of choice, He placed our spirits in bodies and souls that would meet each other and have the

opportunity to get married. Knowing our journey, He gave us every possible resource that we would need to choose each other, but the choice was still ours. No matter what circumstances were set in place to make it difficult, Shari and I’s invitation was to accept our Father’s call to become one flesh. 

The 1980s was a rough decade for both of us. Shari had serious issues at home, and my home had serious issues with me. My soul was wounded, and I’d become angry and rebellious. I was looking for anything to kill the pain and bring stimulation to replace the boredom of life. Then one day, as the song “You Know What To Do” by Stryper rang through my head, I realized that I had never chosen to believe and confess that Jesus could save me. I prayed out loud to the Lord and asked Him to rescue me. I told Him that I wanted to be His and that I needed Him always. He filled me with His Presence, and I knew Him from that day forward.

About a year later, I realized something. I was able to track back over that year and see that whenever I had asked for anything from the Lord, He gave it to me. Of course, I knew I hadn’t asked Him for anything immoral or harmful to me, but what I did request, He gave. When I noticed this, the Lord said, “Now that you know I will give you what you ask for, what do you ask of Me?” I answered, “I ask You for wisdom.” From that day forward, my grades shot up from a C-average to all A’s. 

A few years later, I found myself yearning for my future wife. It started suddenly around Christmas time in 1988. Within a month or two, I was obsessed. I had a crush on a girl who, from seeing pictures later, looked shockingly like Shari did at that time. I finally found the guts to ask her out, and she said yes but had to cancel at the last minute. In the gap, I was distracted by a different girl, one who looked less like Shari and more like me. I ended up dating her instead and falling into an infatuation. I really liked this person, but I wasn’t in love. She was the wrong woman, and it was bad. At the exact same time, Shari became engaged to the wrong man. In August of 1989, she married this person and started a five-year process of some joy and lots of pain. Back in May, I had been diagnosed with the Epstein-Barr strain of

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p> 
{ #p182}

mononucleosis (“mono”). The symptoms were so bad that I spent the entire summer, about three months, in bed. While I lay there virtually unable to move, the girl I was dating had gone home out of state. She was scheduled to come back in August. 

She returned to Tulsa in August of 1989 (just about the time Shari was getting married), but began to struggle with some personal issues. It took her three months to formally break up with me, throughout which, my heart was shattered into pieces. I spent the next five years struggling through the pain of that breakup. I did think I was in love (I was not) and had given my heart to her. 

Shari had a similar experience. The beginning of the marriage was good, but it did not last long. Soon, she felt trapped in a covenant that couldn’t be fulfilled. 

However, there was light in the darkness. At the halfway point of this five-year period, Axel Pearl was born in January 1992. God allowed her to be born then, knowing that I would be the one who would eventually raise her. He knew our choices. He knew that she needed to be born at that time for a purpose, for a destiny. 

In August of 1993, I met Shari while working at Bank of America in Dallas, Texas. My department had just moved from our West Dallas location to our new digs in the Las Colinas headquarters. It was the day that we would meet our new vice president and department head. She came striding down the cubicle aisle first with fierce determination. Behind her was her frighteningly sassy administrative assistant. 

Shari whipped around the corner and pranced her way down the aisle. I don’t remember for sure if the song playing in my head was from Gary Wright or Beyoncé (doubtful as she was in grade school). Regardless, I was struck by something and remember staring at her, trying to figure out what it was. She had a presence about her that demanded my attention. I thought she was at least ten years older than me.

On one rainy Texas day a couple of months later, I stood at her cubicle desk and talked to her about her daughter, whom I did not realize was going to be mine (Axel Pearl). I asked her if she planned to have any more children, and the blood left Shari’s face. “No,” she said. “It doesn’t look like it.” It was then that I realized that her relationship was not going well. I began to pray for her that the Lord’s will would be done in her life. 

Our department split into two sections in December 1993, with mine moving downstairs in the Las Colinas building. Shari’s was moved to the Downtown Dallas “crypt” (secret, unmarked processing building). Due to the nature of our jobs, we spoke to each other on the phone occasionally and ran into each other several times over the next eighteen months. As the new year began, I remember discerning that it was time for me to enter into a marriage covenant. I asked the Lord directly to bring me the person He planned for me to marry.

Five years after they were married, Shari and her husband separated. That same month, I spoke to my former girlfriend on the phone, still hopelessly infatuated with her. She told me that she wasn’t able to visit me in Dallas, and it would be another three years before she’d be available for any relationship. In a single instant, all infatuation I had for her disappeared. It was completely gone. It left so fast I was stunned! I was now free to give my heart to the right woman. 

Then it happened. Shari was at the headquarters building for a meeting. We ran into each other at the bank branch. We had a short conversation in which Shari told me that her marriage had ended. I don’t know if that revelation or what God said after was more shocking. As she walked away, He said, “That is your wife.” 

Shari and I went on our first date after she asked me to lunch, and I countered that we should go to dinner. The next week, we decided to get married. We spent the next seven months building our relationship together and my relationship with Axel Pearl. On June 24, 1995, Shari and I were married in the backyard of my parents’ house by my dear brother, Tom Mohn.

Our lives were running completely parallel to each other from the moment we gave our hearts to the wrong people. How could that be? Our spirits that were together at creation knew who we were supposed to marry, but our souls formed in our mother’s womb had no memory of each other. Our lives were tied to a covenant the Lord had predestined for us before we were born. Our invitation was to choose each other and enter into the covenant freely. Originally, we failed to make the right choice. Fortunately, there was redemption, and with five years of grace, we got it right! 

SHARI’S STORY 

Scott did an amazing job detailing our history. I wish I could deny the prancing portion, but he is probably right. I have a sass factor. It is what it is. That said, let me fill in a few pieces of the picture.

I grew up in a family where image was important. Having a date for events was a sign of success. Getting married young was less a design and more a requirement. It became a standard of measure, and it led to a choice for me outside of Pappa’s will. I wish it wasn’t the case, but I’m so grateful for redemption. It’s hard to admit that the gift of determination I was given by Pappa was used to be rebellious and move outside of His will. But alas, it’s true. 

I became a lover of Jesus when I was seven. I was filled with the Holy Spirit in the same instant. This all occurred in response to the whisper of His voice on a mountaintop. Because of this, His voice has always been precious to me. Growing up, He spoke to me in ways that made those around me feel uncomfortable. Yet those moments talking with Him were my greatest treasures. That truth makes the decision I made to get married surprising because I ignored the voice I loved. I knew I wasn’t supposed to marry the man I did. I knew because Pappa told me I wasn’t. It wasn’t that the person was bad, but he wasn’t the best for me. Years before, Pappa had shown me the husband He had for me. I didn’t see his face, but I knew who he looked like: Jesus. I was given the picture but tried to use my own frame of reference. In doing so, I cropped the picture I was given. It was then incomplete, just like the covenant I had entered into.

Aside from the family expectation I grew up with to marry
ASAP, I can’t say I was convinced or coerced by the wrong man.
It was truly my doing. If at any moment I had said we shouldn’t
have gone through with the wedding, he would have probably

been relieved. We came together through soul wounds in our
past and stayed together for the same reasons. Coming from a
childhood of sexual abuse and trauma, I needed to be accepted. I
also needed to be enough for someone, a piece of happiness they
could hold onto. I wanted to be an answer to something for
which there was only one solution, HIM.
But these were all my responses to Pappa’s invitation not to get
married to the wrong man. I told Him how I could fix things,
how I could lead WM to Him, how I could make it turn out
better that Pappa thought. Poor Pappa, I have been a handful.
None of those reasons were good for getting married. They were
even less equipped to keep a marriage going.
Five years later we stood at the unraveled fabric of it all. Our
common-thread was a beautiful little girl who brought
redemption. I couldn’t look at her and ever again disregard
Pappa’s voice. I was beginning to understand there was hope. I
hadn’t gone beyond where He could reach. In reaching back, we
joined in the covenant of all He was thinking when He created
me and a chance to journey together to that destination. I had
been Gomer, running from the one who loved me so. But He
removed the shackles of bondage so I could receive a gift greater
than I was able to imagine.
That package was wrapped in an earth-suit called Scott. I laugh
as I write this, because Scott is sitting across the room. As I look
at him, I realize Pappa wasn’t kidding when He said he would
look like Jesus. Pappa uses colorful illustrations and sometimes
he gets quite literal. If you have seen Scott, you know what I
mean!
For this redemptive moment in history, Pappa worked out every
detail. I was a single mom and Scott was single, period. But
Pappa knew. Sometime before He told Scott that I was his wife,
he told him he would marry a woman with a child. That was a
bit surprising, as Scott was awaiting a bride who was pure. A
virgin.

Like the Bride of Christ, I didn’t arrive spotless. I had many a blemish. All I knew was that my spirit recognized Scott. I knew him from creation. I didn’t just recognize him; I knew I was part of him. I had a covenant with him, and it mattered that it was completed. I began to see the truth of how earthly marriage was created as a rendering, not of a marriage we were going to have, but one we were already in. I became overwhelmed and impassioned by the revelation that our marriage, and all marriage, was meant to be a picture of the restoration of one flesh. I was then undone by the picture of what those who are single represent. They carry the cry of the Groom and the groan of creation to be made one. Together, we journey to the restoration of all that is yet to be reconciled. We’re on a pilgrimage to a destination called the Tabernacle. 

RESTORATION OF ALL THINGS 

“He must remain in heaven until the time comes for God to restore everything, as He promised long ago through His holy prophets.” Acts 3:21 (NIV 1984) 

Husbands and wives become one flesh. Likewise, in spirit, God’s children, both married and unmarried, are becoming one flesh as one Body (1 Cor. 12:27), filled with the Holy Spirit of Christ. Then, we will become one flesh with all of creation as the Holy City of Jerusalem, which is the marriage chamber for our wedding with Jesus. Finally, our Groom, Jesus, will become one flesh with all of creation, and return to His head, the Father (1 Cor. 11:3). In so doing, all things will be restored back to their state before creation. Jesus is the cornerstone that connects us all together (Isa. 28:16). God is one who is three. From His heart came all of creation, and we became many. So, One became many, and many are becoming One. The lover and loved of God will be one flesh for all of eternity! 

COMPLETING COVENANT 

The choice to get married should solely be a response to an invitation from the Lord. If you say yes, that person is a part of your covenant with God; you don’t want to marry anyone else. If there wasn’t an invitation, you don’t want to go ahead and get married. Our Father created us to groan for the fulfillment of

<p style="text-align:center;">
- 187 -

</p> 
{ #p187}


---

covenant (Rom. 8:22–26). We’re meant to bring the desire of Heaven to Earth. In Hebrew, the word for desire includes tav, which is “a sign or mark.” If we’re married, the first manifestation of wholeness we model in covenant is with our spouse. Whether married or not, we also establish covenant as the Body. Finally, we fulfill our covenant with Jesus as His unified Bride. Missing any of these could keep us from the fullness of our destiny. 

“When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite. They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.” Genesis 26:34–35 

Can you marry someone who isn’t Pappa’s choice for you? Absolutely. Just as Shari got married and I gave my heart to another, you can enter into covenant with a person whose spirit was not joined with you at creation. Esau made his own decision of who to marry, unlike his father Isaac, whose wife was chosen for him by God, and his brother Jacob, who listened to his mother’s discernment, which came from the Lord. Rebekah became a signpost to Abraham’s servant when he went to the town of Nahor to find a wife for Isaac (Gen. 24:12–16). After that, Rebekah was the signpost for Jacob when she sent him to her brother Laban’s people to find a wife. Based on Jesus’ lineage, Jacob chose the wrong person (Rachel), but the Lord intervened (allowing Laban’s deceit) because it was Jacob’s heart to be obedient. The result was a marriage to Leah that produced Judah, the lineage father of King David and King Jesus. Our Father even redeemed the marriage with Rachel to produce Joseph, who rescued all of Israel from famine during the seven- year drought. 

What do you do if you don’t know if you married the right person? Ask! The Lord wants to show you what He was thinking when He created you and your spouse. Ask Him to remind you why you married the person you did. If it was His will, then you are empowered to pray for that person. You now know that there is a purpose for the two of you together as one flesh. That purpose is the fulfillment of your covenant. You want to pursue your daily bread of what that is so one day, you can see it manifest for both you and your spouse!

“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace.” Ephesians 1:7 

What do you do if God reveals you married the wrong person? Do not seek a divorce! Stop and take a deep breath. Then start by repenting for either not inquiring of the Lord before marrying or rejecting His answer. Receive the blood of Jesus, declare your testimony, and hurl down the accuser. Next, pursue your portion of our Father’s will done each day. Seek, ask, knock! The Father isn’t surprised by our bad choices, but He is very interested in how we respond now. There is ample time and resources in the Kingdom to bring about massive, positive change in your life! God is able! Your spouse may not want to go along for the journey right now, but that is okay. The Lord has a plan for bringing all covenants to fulfillment, those He ordained and even those He did not! 

SPIRIT TO SPIRIT

Many following the Lord are aware people are comprised of spirit, soul, and body. Many know that our spirits are meant to lead the way, but few know how to walk that out. If we aren’t aware of our spirit, it’s very difficult to be aware of someone else’s. That’s why many of our relationships were established at the soul level, which is primarily self-focused (selfish). Real love is challenging, if not impossible, to maintain through a soul connection alone. The soul is designed to be released from but not be the source of a covenant. The foundation of covenants are meant to be established at a spirit level. From that place, Love flows freely because it’s His love. If the soul is used as the source of everything, a tainted love is produced that cannot withstand testing fire.

Your spirit can be felt within you, right in the center of your chest, which is how most people come to call it the “heart.” This isn’t to be confused with the part of you that houses desires and passions (also called the “heart”). As you grow and discern your own spirit, you can actually feel it connect with others. When our spirit leads us, our motivation is not self but the will of our Father. This always produces the fruit of Love and intimacy. A

wounded soul wants to feed its selfish desires. It limits or shuts down access to the spirit. The spirit wants to see that which is eternal, unconditional, and selfless. The spirit wants Love. 

The spirit and soul are meant to work together. As an analogy, we could think of the soul as being a cervix and the spirit a womb. The soul, therefore, is the gateway or door from the spirit. When a wounded soul has a clog or a shut gate to the spirit, the soul never receives what’s coming from Heaven. This door must be opened. Even then, emotions, thoughts, and the will must stand down so the spirit can be fully released. That requires healing of soul wounds through the integration of splinters in daily bread portions. Only then will we be able to connect spirit to spirit. 

We have found that as our souls are healed, we can recognize our spirits more and more. When Scott drives down our street, I can discern that he’s coming. There is a sense of completion you can actually feel when your spirit connects to the one the Father called you into covenant with. In His graciousness to us, the Father will allow us to see His covenant, who we were created to be, in each other. This is worth pursuing and becomes more real when we’ve connected spirit to spirit. We can then pull each other out of our conditions and into the fullness of our covenant. 

MAIDENS AND CHAMPIONS 

Every human being has a covenant calling from our Father, including your spouse. Yet most of us get preoccupied with their condition, which might be that they are fearful, angry, controlling, detached, or addicted to something. While these are soul wounds powered by strongholds of deception and can be dismantled, the Lord is also calling us to focus our prayers on their covenants. As we walk toward one flesh together, we will find that there are many who will agree with our condition but few who will fight for our covenant. 

Women represent the Bride and want to be discovered. They are romantic and dream of relational connections. They want to be seen, understood, and known. Women are created to be supernatural and have a deep yearning for their spiritual destiny. They groan inwardly to give birth to life, having an intimate

understanding of when something needs to be born in alignment with perfect timing. They recognize the need of partnering with a strong champion to see what is birthed grow to completion.

Men represent the Groom and want to discover. Men love adventure and are drawn toward the pursuit of treasure, survival, and solving problems on the fly. Men want to be the champion or the hero. They want to be recognized for their accomplishments and remembered. They strive to have a lasting mark on creation that is remembered eternally. They want to fight for and protect that which is dear to them, even unto death. 

The current condition we’re facing is that our maidens are locked up in towers, and their rescuing champions are too wounded to go and get them. Making matters worse, the maidens often see their champions as being the ones who locked them up. Likewise, the champions see their maidens as the ones who wounded them. The only way this cycle can be dismantled is if somebody lays down their life and dies for the other. When we seek fulfillment for ourselves instead of pursuing the completion of another, we remain separate in a covenant meant to make us one. We must fill the void in each other by bringing what is good to them. When some zip-lock bags are properly closed, there is a yellow seal that is attached to a blue seal. The two together make one color: green! The contents are protected and easy to carry. Everything is in its right place! CONDITIONS She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.” Proverbs 31:12 Many of us entered relationships with each other as adults, having a life before our covenant together. Through this, many people feel that there are two lives to consider, one before the marriage and one after. However, when we join into covenant, the Lord views it from His eternal perspective: we were in covenant all the days of our lives. Still, choices we made and generational curses we inherited affect our partners and must be dealt with so we’re free to move to wholeness.

Most people born in the Silent, Baby Boomer, and Gen X generations did not take purity vows and had intimate relationships with others that resulted in soul ties. This is an excellent example of conditions that need to be dealt with as you start, or continue, your life in covenant with each other. We also need to resolve existing conditions causing issues of trust in our relationships. We must repent for creating these soul ties and forgive the people we entered into covenant with, washing all parties with the blood of Jesus and declaring the testimony so the ties are dismantled. 

There are several splinters that can have a direct effect on the condition of a covenant relationship. The five Core Splinters must be dealt with first: the Child (fear), the Bodyguard (anger), the Loner (control and isolation), the Rebel, and the Addict (self- sourcing). In addition to these, there are other soul wounds that can work to prevent couples from reaching wholeness. Like all splinters, these wounds don’t have to control us. They are easily dealt with when we yield to our Father’s timing in His Light and through the fullness of forgiveness. 

The Eve splinter is a common one for women, though it can affect both genders. The manifestation of this wound could be compared to standing in the middle of a beautiful garden and only being able to see what you lack. From this place, testimonies are no longer celebrated. Discussions become about what has not happened yet. It’s a place of little rest and the belief that one is being held out on. This leads to accusations toward others and God.

The Adam splinter usually manifests when a man feels inadequate, like he has let someone down or fallen short of God’s glory. Shame causes him to hide, though he desperately wants to be found so everything can be put back in order. It leads to shutting down, withdrawing, and remaining silent when a problem arises. It can cause anger at and accusation toward those who try to find you and extreme resistance to accountability. 

The One Flesh splinter is less a result of something that happens as it is something that does not. We’re each created with the internal understanding that we’re meant to complete something. We recognize our design to bring Heaven’s reality in preparation

for our ultimate destination of becoming one flesh. Few of us have had one flesh modeled for us on the earth. When our parents or previous generations don’t become one flesh, it causes trauma. This trauma results in a separation within ourselves. 

A manifestation of the One Flesh splinter is the inability to connect with others in marriage, family, and the Body of Christ. It also causes comparison within collective groups that leads to mistrust. This is a result of seeing our parents use their gifts against each other or for the purpose of remaining separate. Another manifestation is that we cannot share in someone else’s victories because the wound leads us to competition. 

A physical manifestation of the One Flesh splinter is the inability to collect thoughts or put puzzle pieces together; we’re currently pursuing the idea that this is a part of Alzheimer’s. It’s as if there is something you should be able to access but cannot get to. This wound creates a division between our soul and spirit and between both sides of our brain. Science tells us that most people are either right or left-brain dominant, but God’s plan is that all things divided will be reconciled. What if the side we utilize the most relates to the parent we were able to best connect with? We hear phrases such as, “I’m like my mom,” or “I think like my dad,” and believe that’s our standard. However, one flesh allows equal access to both parts of the brain and the unity of our soul and spirit. The splinter causes people to try and complete things that aren’t in their covenant because that part of them is crying out to be completed. If parents do not become one flesh, the family cannot either, and they enter a state of flux. The enemy wants us to feel incomplete so we won’t move forward.

The Indentured Servant splinter occurs most often when we’re born into a situation of generational debt. The sins of the parents, which are usually the sins of the grandparents and/or great- grandparents, cause an obligation that’s passed on to their children from the womb. Debts of shame, false responsibility, or illegitimacy all come from sins that were traumatic or acts of abandonment, betrayal, or neglect. A person with this splinter will often be plagued with financial troubles or the feeling that they can never get ahead.

When a person has this wounding, what should be free access to them seems to require a cost. The vav that should hold the Temple curtains open becomes like a hook keeping them from going into the Presence of the Lord. One of the most serious manifestations of this splinter is when the person indentures others. They may force innocent people to pay off their “debts” or the “debts” that others have to them. This imposed liability can keep a person from reaching the fullness of their covenant. 

Splinters are one hundred percent self-focused. When a relationship of two or more occurs between splinters within people, the results can be disastrous. This is especially true when people gather “in the name of the Lord,” but the result is a covenant of not-Love between their splinters. If this occurs between a married person and someone outside their covenant, the marriage is at risk. If this occurs within the marriage, the wholeness of the covenant is jeopardized.

When praying for your marriage and spouse, you may do some kinsman-redeeming. You will find that present-day behaviors can be caused by generational sins in the family line. You might be afraid because Grandma was afraid. You might be angry because Dad was angry. Great-Grandpa Horton was addicted to moonshine, and now you might be too. Each generational wounding must be dismantled so your marriage can reach wholeness. When the DNA is cleared of the memory of those sins, you and your spouse can be truly free. 

In Hebrew, the number two (bet) means covenant and has the pictorial representation of a house. The residence and land we’re led to are meant to be a part of the fulfillment of our covenant. The memory of sins within the land or things on the property may be giving the enemy a legal right to bring decay to our lives. Ask the Lord to shine His Light and reveal any hidden sins and all the hidden treasures within your residence. Then forgive those who sinned and declare the storehouses released! 

THE REFLECTION

When we’re physically intimate with our spouse, we’re reflecting Heaven. Our Father created us to bond when we’re together, but there is more that occurs. The seeds that are being

transferred naturally are an earthly manifestation of the heavenly seeds being passed from spirit to spirit. The spirit receives, the soul releases, and the body expresses. When we enter into God’s plan for physical intimacy, we will see much fruit harvested in our marriage! 

As we discussed earlier, our motivation must be our Father’s heart and will. The stimulation to come together physically should come from the spirit, not the soul and flesh. Our Father fills us with the purposes of Love and fulfills our covenant. We’re given an opportunity to give where we have expected to receive in the past. 

When our motivation is ourselves, we have a high likelihood of feeling inadequate or blaming our spouse for a “bad experience.” Some people use intimacy to control their spouse. Other times, we’re unable to be together due to distrust, fear, anger, or physical issues. Additionally, emotional and mental adultery is as bad in the spiritual realm as physical affairs can be in the natural. For the health of the relationship, these must be dismantled as if they had occurred in the natural. 

When stimulation is coming from Heaven through your spirit, intimacy is a totally different story. Our flesh is not being fed anymore. You are no longer exposed to soul wounds that result in fear, anger, control, and distrust. We are learning to deny our flesh daily and gain the life our Father has planned for us! We receive the infusions from Heaven that bring us closer to fullness and all He has set aside for us!

KEEPING THE COVENANT

“Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.” Ephesians 5:21 

All covenants with the Lord, no matter what function they provide in the Body, are covenants of Love. By definition, they are based on eternal selflessness. We choose to enter the marriage covenant when we deny ourselves and lose our lives daily. By being humble before each other, we make room for the Father to move in all of our lives. It’s so transformative when we recognize that the Lord has a plan. We must be willing to place

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p> 
{ #p195}

what we know from our education, mentors, culture, society, and every other source on the altar. We must be willing to give up our preconceived notions for what the Father is saying. 

To keep a covenant, you have to know the covenant. A great way to build trust is to pursue daily bread by first seeking the treasures in each other. These remind us of our covenant and create a safe place for sharing deeper things. Finding them helps us recognize each other again by seeing the places we’ve forgotten. 

Conversely, the person we’re looking for change in should always be ourselves first. There is a mirror that the Lord gives us to see the log in our own eyes. By remembering our own shortcomings, we never fall into the pit of judgment and accusation against our spouse. 

“‘Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet My unfailing love [hesed] for you will not be shaken nor My covenant of peace be removed,’ says the Lord, who has compassion on you.” Isaiah 54:10 

It’s time we acquire a richer and deeper understanding of ‘love’ than what’s been expressed in the English language. There is a word that gives us a much narrower definition. That word is hesed (H2617). It’s the love that embodies covenant. In Hebrew, it means “a mutual exchange of affection.” It means to love as God loves. It exists beyond any transgression or betrayal, and it’s not lost due to circumstances. Hesed love means “no matter what it takes.” It’s a love without fear, which means it’s perfect love. Where perfect love is, fear cannot be. 

“The Lord said to me, ‘Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another and is an adulteress. Love her as the Lord loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes.’ So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and about a homer and a lethek of barley. Then I told her, ‘You are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man, and I will live with you.’” Hosea 3:1–3

Hesed is a love that is promised and owed. Hosea went to rescue Gomer from her debt. We’re called to do the same. Hesed is a provision of Love where we can pay off another’s deficits. When you hesed, you know you are owed but choose to pay off a debt with your own life. For hesed love to exist, someone must die. Our covenant with Jesus was one of hesed. He died first to rescue us so we could live. Now, we’re called to die for another so they can live as well. 

To lay down our life for someone, we must have fierce love for them. We get the joy of rescuing each other, regardless of whether the person has hurt us or not. We must lay down our distrust, fear, anger, pride, and control to become vulnerable. If we allow Him, He will show us why they’re worth dying for. 

We can ask the Lord to shine His Light to show us any way we’ve seen our spouse with eyes of selfishness, so hindrances can be dismantled. Then our flesh can die, and we get resurrected. The wholeness of our marriage can then be manifested. We can ask the Lord to shine His Light every day from then on. From there, we pursue their daily bread of Pappa’s will done and grow into fullness over time. When sin is revealed, we forgive, even if someone hurts our spouse and it causes us great pain. When our life is laid down, we have a full bank account from which to pay off the debt of another. 

Every day that we die to ourselves, we become pregnant with His love. If your spouse is addicted, ask the Lord to shine His Light to reveal any pain they’re trying to cover or void they’re trying to fill. If your spouse withdraws and isolates, ask Pappa what shame they’re cloaked in that causes them to feel naked. Ask Him how to cover and clothe them in Love so they feel safe again. Sometimes, the hardest thing to do is inquire when we know the answer won’t be to give up, hide, or leave—but to stay, fight, and love. Love is not the fight; it’s what we fight for.

In the movie August Rush, the character Wizard asks August what he wants to be in the world. He tells him to close his eyes and think about that. August keeps his eyes open and tells Wizard that what he wanted to be was “found.” That is our heart cry: to be found, not by each other but in each other. To be found, we have to be able to see the One who sees us.

“For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) and find out what pleases the Lord. Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: ‘Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.’” Ephesians 5:8–14 (NIV 1984) 

Leah’s eyes were weak because she could only see that she wasn’t chosen by Jacob. She couldn’t see that she was chosen by God. Because she didn’t believe she had a dowry, she thought she had no inheritance. As the foremother of David and Jesus, she had both. When we’ve fallen asleep, we need someone to wake us up. When you wake, you open your eyes and Light comes in. When your eyes receive Light, your body is filled with Light, and you can see that you are chosen. In marriage, we have the honor of waking each other up. 

“Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one [echad].” Deuteronomy 6:4

Hesed love leads us to echad (H259), which in Hebrew, means “no more separate parts.” The Lord has painted the picture for us in the fabric of His Word. At creation, He was One that became Three and produced many from His heart. He humbled Himself to our choices so Love could be fully defined. Through the Cornerstone, our bridegroom, Jesus, we become one in our covenants, first with our spouse and then with each other. We then become one flesh with Jesus, who becomes one with the Father. The eternal Love we’re called to enter into has no more separate parts. One became many, and many will become One.

KEY 

Marriage is a covenant established by our Father at creation that is fulfilled, first, by our choices of yielding to Him, and second, by how we unify with the Body, then Jesus, and finally, God.

Chapter Sixteen

Family 

“When they reached the Valley of Eshcol, they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs.” Numbers 13:23 (NIV 1984) 

The Promised Land in Canaan represents both Heaven and the Kingdom of God on Earth. All of the covenants of the Lord were represented in the Promised Land. When the twelve spies returned from scouting it, they brought back three samplings of the fruit of the land: a cluster of grapes, pomegranates, and figs. Each of these was a signpost that the land was good. The Lord provided the people with confirmation that His word is true. 

King Solomon used pomegranates to decorate the outside of the temple (1 Kings 7:18). Pomegranates represent the friends of God. They have seen Him face-to-face. They have entered the Most Holy Place of God’s Presence through the blood of the Lamb (Heb. 10:19). Because of this, they have clean hands and a pure heart and are able to ascend the mountain of God. But they are friends, not family. They have their own lives and their own house that they live in. 

“Early in the morning, as He was on His way back to the city, He was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, He went up to it but

found nothing on it except leaves. Then He said to it, ‘May you never bear fruit again!’ Immediately the tree withered.” Matthew 21:18–19 

Figs represent the servants of God. They have freely chosen to believe in the invisible. They have taken a risk, believed the Truth, and confessed Jesus with their mouths. They haven’t denied Christ but have embraced Him. They are servants, not friends or family. They haven’t been washed by Jesus’ blood on a daily basis. They haven’t been intimate with the Master and produced the fruit Jesus expects of us. They’re not allowed past the city of New Jerusalem’s gates. 

Lastly, the grapes represent the family of God. They are one cluster, separate parts that are a whole. They have given up their lives daily to gain the life their Father has for them. Family lives in the Master’s house. The Feast of Tabernacles is about a single family all living in one booth (sukkah). This picture points us to the fulfillment of our covenant of being one flesh!

BIRTH ORDER 

In families, the firstborn child is the steward of the family’s covenant. As stewards, they are trusted with honor. The measure of honor they bring to the family and covenant will be modeled by the rest of the family. They’re meant to stretch and challenge so the covenant can be taken deeper and understood more fully. They’re a bridge between the vision and reality of the covenant. They’re driven by a call to be a part of something bigger than themselves. God designed them to enter highways to make rough places smooth for those who come behind. It’s imperative that we fuel them with the knowledge that they are driving for something, not against something. They drive toward, not away. If what they see around them doesn’t match the family seal (covenant) they will move as one being driven away. As a result, the destination they choose may not be God’s best. 

It’s often said middle children struggle to find who they are. Identity can often be difficult for them. In family, they can feel the least seen. As the filling in the middle of the proverbial Oreo, they may regularly feel insignificant or minimized. The truth is that they are like a homing device for the family’s covenant.

They can be a beacon that shines or an alarm that sounds. They’re meant to be a family thermostat but often become a thermometer. If a middle child (or children; it’s a fun dynamic to see multiple middles work together in this gifting) isn’t shown how to handle the discernment they receive, they will become receptacles of what’s pulsing through the family. Whether good or bad is being discerned, the struggle remains if they don’t know what to do with it. The end result is a loss of identity because they can’t distinguish between themselves and others. They get lost and cry out to be found through manifestations of what they discern because it becomes too much for them. A middle child in this situation is very likely to squander or lose inheritance. An amazing blessing of the middle child is that because they are able to discern much from many; they are incredible connectors in the family and the Body!

Last-born children are a gate. They have a unique ability to receive from Heaven and release to Earth. They often have an immense, intense revelatory gift. Many have attributed this trait to last-borns benefiting from seeing what happened with their siblings before them. In reality, they are sponges meant to soak up Heaven and wash the feet of those around them with it. They are reconcilers. Things left incomplete are hard for them. In fact, they are often accused of not finishing what they begin, of being aimless and without direction. This characteristic is because they long to see things reconciled and made whole; they are testers. They will put fire to what is before them to see if it’s real. This is an amazing gift for the family, but one that is often left unopened. Like a gate, these children can be locked up and left with no place to release what they’ve received. A last-born will often give out what they’ve received in a way that brings harm. Because they can be left unattended, they may be drawn to expressions outside of God’s will. They thrive in and need an environment where they’re invited to walk in their role; they’re gifted to reconcile the family to the fullness of covenant instead of the end of it. 

Families who not only tap into but fully release their children to destiny command a blessing beyond compare. The unity of their family’s gifts and callings brings this blessing. Allowing each child to thrive as an individual is a treasure. Understanding the importance of walking in the family covenant is far above rubies.

f children aren’t given the opportunity to fulfill their birth order in the spirit, not only is part of their destiny missed, but also the destiny of the family. If a firstborn doesn’t take their place, another child will fill it, and their true destiny will be cut short. The unity of destiny commands the blessing of fulfilled covenant. 

GENERATION Y AND Z 

In Chapter 10, we talked about generational covenants and the ways the enemy has schemed to keep each generation from finishing the race well (Heb. 12:1). Since we’re now sharing on family, we felt it would be important to include the list again: 

Generation   Covenant and Blessing.  Opposing Splinter    
Silent: 1925–1945 Bring order to chaos. Fruitful / rest anointing Child (S1) 
Boomers: 1946–1964 Gatekeepers. Tapping into the Father’s heart Loner (S5) 
Gen X: 1965–1981 Remnant. Unification and bridge builders Rebel (S3) 
Gen Y: 1982–2000 Supernatural anointing Addict (S4) 
Gen Z: 2001–present Restorers. Reconcilers. Recover stolen booty! Peter Pan (S27)

All of these are detailed in Chapter 10, except Gen Z. As you step into Terraforming for your family, it’s good to have a solid understanding of each covenant as it pertains to the generations in your household and extended family. We were so excited when Pappa began speaking about Gen Z and the dynamic combo they create with Gen Y!

<p style="text-align:center;">

The covenant of Gen X is restoration. They not only know there’s something they can do about what they see, but they won’t stop short until they do. This generation will take back what the enemy’s robbers have stolen. The way they can risk missing their covenant is being convinced to trade it for what they want instead of returning it to the Kingdom. They can also fall prey to seeking their own justice instead of waiting until Pappa sends them to recover what’s been taken. In other words, they can be led to take matters into their own hands. 

THWARTING THE ENEMY’S PLAN

There are times in family where a surprise is very welcome. Surprise parties and guests can bring great delight. Surprise attacks of the enemy, however, don’t fall into this category. Instead of bringing joy, they only derail and devastate. But Pappa has a much better plan for us than recovering from an assault of the enemy: 

“Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by their families, with their swords, spears and bows. After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, ‘Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.’ When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his own work.” Nehemiah 4:13–15 (NIV 1984) 

This is one of my favorite verses! First, it tells us to be at the exposed places. From there, we “fight” for each other. Whenever I see the word ‘home’ in Scripture, I think of covenant because of the number two, or letter bet, which means “covenant.” So, we fight for one another and the covenant we’ve entered into. 

The next thing the verse says is that because of how they were stationed, strategically and in unity, all the enemy needed to be frustrated was for the people to be aware of what they were up to. Because Light invaded the darkness, they were unable to carry out the plan. When this happened, all the people went back

---
<p style="text-align:center;">
- 203 -

</p> 
{ #p203}


---

to what they were doing. In addition to returning to the work they were given, they continued to watch. They stayed awake. They weren’t afraid; they were wise. 

The people didn’t just receive from their covenant with God. They were part of it. ‘Watch’ (shamar, H8104) means “to take charge of, to guard, or to keep.” Like those who walked before us, we’re called to keep and guard covenant. Each part of our family (natural or spiritual) has a destiny, a covenant sealed upon them. To guard that covenant, we call in the Light and ask Pappa to show us what the enemy’s plans are. Pappa delights in revealing these things for us. 

We have sought the Lord for each of our children. He’s revealed their covenant, their destiny, to us. He’s also faithfully revealed what lies in wait in the enemy’s strategy tent so we may dismantle (frustrate) those schemes. Many times, I’ve been alerted or awakened in the night by the whisper of one of the kids’ names. Because I’m aware of the enemy’s plan, I can quickly frustrate it and go back to what I was doing.

It’s okay if you haven’t done this from the time your child was in the womb to the present day. Pappa redeems, and His time is now. Begin calling in the Light for your children, seeking daily bread you can offer each of them. I’ve been completely wrecked over and over as I’ve gone to the bakery of Heaven for my kids. So often, what I thought needed to be “dealt with” was not only not in the bread basket, but it wasn’t even baked yet! Daily bread opens our eyes to how Pappa sees them and what’s truly important. I might want to deal with a fruit, but He wants to extract a root. I might want to tell the kids who they are not, but He wants me to tell them who they are. As they grow, you can share with them all Pappa has revealed, and they can pursue daily bread themselves. 

Asking, seeking, and knocking are powerful tools for us (Luke 11:10). If we pursue Him, He pursues us with treasures untold. As you begin to seek Him for your children and family, He will reveal so much for you to excavate. Many of the enemy’s schemes are anchored in generational iniquity and can be intercepted before coming to fruition.

One issue for many young people right now is cutting. I don’t think it’s a surprise to hear that the enemy uses cutting for bloodshed to fuel his plans. I’ve found while praying for many who struggled with this issue that the root lies in the generations and iniquity of bloodshed called abortion. When the one struggling forgives those in their family line who were part of that bloodshed, their desire to draw blood ceases. There are other aspects to this issue to deal with as well. Cutting is done in a effort to relieve pain. In the Light, you can look for a trauma that occurred that is allowing the enemy to use a legal right within the family against your child.

Suicide can also be related to bloodshed in the family line. Depression can be a symptom of a death that occurred in the womb from abortion or miscarriage. When destiny dies, it can have an effect on the children that follow. These are things that can be dealt with, simply and easily using the Keys (the Light, daily bread, forgiving with the blood and authority of Jesus and the word of our testimony). The most important thing is to begin. Don’t become frustrated if your children are already older. We all wish we had known these things from the start. Our sweet daughter, Faith, struggled with fear for quite some time. When we were given the Keys, we were able to call in the Light and found it was because of the death of her twin in the womb. We dismantled that issue, and she was free! 

Our son, Toggle, also struggled with fear. (I asked his permission to share this). It would manifest if he had to be away from me (Shari). He didn’t want to do anything, even if he loved it, if it meant being apart from me. When he was little, it was okay, but as he got older, we became concerned. Not long after Scott received the Keys, I felt led to see what I could find out from the Lord, and in the Light, I had a memory. When our daughter, Erin, was born, Togg had been running a fever for ten days. No cause could be found. When we came home from the hospital, the doctor said we needed to watch Erin and bring her in if she had symptoms. At a week old, she developed a fever, so she, Togg, and I went into the doctor’s office. They felt she needed to be admitted to the hospital for testing. As we walked from the office to the hospital, I saw my next-door neighbor, who was leaving a prenatal exam. I had a

---
<p style="text-align:center;">
- 205 -

</p> 
{ #p205}


---

concern about Togg. Seeing a spinal tap performed could be traumatic, so I asked my neighbor if she could take Toggle home with her until Scott could pick him up. She graciously took him with her. In the Light, I realized that, though I was doing what I thought best for Togg, it hurt him and allowed fear into his life. Realizing this, I walked him through Terraforming that situation. I asked him to forgive me for abandoning him. It didn’t matter that this wasn’t my intent. It mattered that this was what he perceived. After praying, he never struggled with that fear again! 

For others to be free, we must overcome the fear of having our sins exposed. We’ve been part of several Terraforming sessions with Axel Pearl. Going in, I felt certain that she would be forgiving her biological father for a lot of stuff. Guess whose name kept coming up? Mine! It was hard. I said “ouch” a lot! But it was worth it. Axel and I already had a good relationship, but since then, it’s been off-the-charts amazing. I know the biggest part was her seeing that I would stand right in the Light with her and eat daily bread together. 

Even if what’s revealed in the Light isn’t about you, it can still be hard. His Presence can prompt confessions you weren’t expecting. This is a good thing. It’s fruit! We must be willing to see that fruit sometimes looks different than what we expect. If we’re set on immediately peeling and eating a banana, we might miss the avocado (a fruit) He’s given us. Our avocado may need time to ripen so it’s good for guacamole. We may get to use it for an entire Mexican extravaganza! However, if we just want a quick fill from a fruit that can be eaten right away, good will become a stumbling block to the best. Though hearing or seeing something difficult isn’t fun, it’s a test that leads to testimony. What a privilege to walk our family through the truth in the Light instead of despairing at what’s revealed from the darkness. Pappa really trusts us with His greatest treasures: each other! 

As you have probably gleaned from all above, when we say family, we aren’t just referring to our natural families but our spiritual ones as well. For us, the two are the same (because two become one). It’s an awesome thing for me as a mother of five natural children to be part of a family that continues to grow, and I don’t have to be pregnant (in the natural, anyway) for that to happen. It’s also amazing how the line between our natural and

---
<p style="text-align:center;">
- 206 -

</p> 
{ #p206}

spiritual family has blurred to the point that there is no line. That was the Church of the New Testament! It wasn’t a meeting or a building; it was a life lived together. We are on a rescue mission with each other, for each other. 

Written below are excerpts from the “Ma Journal”! These are invitations Pappa has given for us to see, rescue, and celebrate each other as the years have gone by. These are some of the ways He has created a cluster, many parts that have come together to make a whole. They are passions for me, and I hope they prove practical for you as you pursue the more that is yours! 

FAMILY FEAST 

Just like we eat meals together, we pursue daily bread together. It’s not a meeting we have but moments we experience. Feasting together in this way has changed the entire dynamic of our family. Pursuing bread has become equal to pursuing each other. It’s brought an atmosphere of honor into our home that is incredible. We walk together in the test and the testimony. Since we walk through each other’s hard parts, we truly see one another. This leaves little room for accusation. This was demonstrated one night as we played the game of Clue. I guess you could call it an anti-Terraforming game since the point is to accuse someone. Faith put her cards down and said, “What’s with all the accusations? Doesn’t anyone love anymore?” It’s a glorious moment when accusation and offense are not the foundation of life together. 

When one of us is struggling, we see it as Pappa’s pursuit. A negative becomes a positive as the pursued one becomes the family assignment. It really helps the one walking through healing to be reminded the enemy isn’t after them, because Pappa is pursuing them. A picture is worth a thousand words, right? We’ve found they are worth much more than that. For years, I have pulled out the kids’ memory albums. I ask for the Light to shine and reveal anything hidden. So many times, He has revealed things. 

For others I’ve known who’ve called in the Light, sexual abuse and other trauma has been revealed, and families have been able to deal with something once hidden. What an awesome Pappa.

For me, it’s been more destiny-related. He wants to show me about each child. The exception is when I’m looking at an album with one of the kids, and Pappa has used it to reveal ways we may have hurt them and not realized or remembered. We can repent and forgive. Other times, our kids share how much something meant to them, and we recognize a way we have blessed them. These moments usually mean they have a daily bread of being blessed that way again. 

To be the generation Jesus cried out for, the generations must come together. Just as in Horton Hears a Who, it took every voice to get that “Yopp!” loud enough to be heard. The last voice that came in was a little boy. It isn’t that children aren’t speaking but that those who should listen don’t hear. Children can be treated as if they have a junior Holy Spirit and shouldn’t be heard until they are older or “old enough.” 

For me, I will not have a cessor, Flight/Ground Crew, or other prayer team without children being a part of it. I don’t mean as a token presence but as a vital, thriving, even leading, part of the team. I’ve seen the shyest, most withdrawn child blossom instantly when given a chance to share what they see or hear from Pappa. 

Because kids haven’t always been treated like trusted voices of Heaven, we must give them a safe place to become courageous in releasing what they receive. Since we have often not allowed their voices to be heard, we need a place to become courageous in hearing it! Home should be the safest place there is; if not, we should make it so. The following activities are my favorite ways we’ve opened the gates of Heaven, our children. 

<u>Under the Mantle:</u> This activity works great at home, in ministry, or cessor teams, etc. Everyone gathers in circle. A large mantle (worship cloth, shawl) is placed in the center. With all eyes closed, the leader chooses a person to go under the mantle. Everyone in the circle begins resting in for what Pappa would speak regarding that person. Since no one knows who’s under the mantle, the flow of what Pappa says opens like a dam breaking. The leader then writes all the words down. In a group where everyone knows each other well, it’s fun to watch the

surprised faces when it’s revealed who the words were for. It becomes really hard to relate to someone based on a condition when you’ve seen their covenant. 

<u>Numbers</u>: This is similar to the mantle game. All present draw a number and don’t share it with anyone. As each number is called, everyone shares what they hear or see. A lot of times, we will specifically say to rest in for what each person’s spirit looks, smells, or sounds like. Our land teams do this often, and we can recognize each other’s spirits without ever being near each other. A fun twist is to relate each number to the Hebrew aleph-bet. It adds an element of depth for each person. 

<u>Map It</u>: One of our favorite things to do is to lay out a big floor map. We all rest together to see if there is a place Pappa wants to send us. As we hear His location, we go to the map. It’s amazing how many times we’ve ended up in the same state or country. Each of us has a different piece though. When we bring those pieces together in unity, amazing things happen. Once, we were all “in” Australia. When we prayed into the picture we put together, all our hands were filled with gold dust and oil. 

A twist on this game is to all “travel” to a birth state of someone in the family or team. If we don’t already know the blessings of that land, we rest in for that. We ask Pappa why it was important for that person to be born there, what the blessing in the land is (which is also their inheritance), and how it affects their covenant. We have also used this in homeschooling. Because of our travel for Blue Flame, our geography lessons are based on our trips. We will rest in regarding a place we’re going. I can’t tell you how many times those clues ended up being a foundation for our whole trip. 

<u>Treasure Hunts</u>: Treasure hunts are not unfamiliar to us. I’ve always loved them, but I especially love spiritual treasure hunts. There are many ways you can do these, including going out into your city to look for treasure. My favorites, though, are the ones designed for something to be found or seen in the spirit. These work just like a standard treasure hunt. Items are hidden throughout the house or yard, but the last item is a surprise. Once, our hunt ended with “find an angel.” The kids quickly found all the items on the list. That last one was a bit tougher.

They came to me several times and asked if the angel was a statue or in a picture. Soon, I sent them into a room void of any “physical” angel. Within minutes the first team saw an angel in the room. As each of the other teams came in, they began seeing, too. By the end of the hunt, they had seen nine angels and were covered in glory glitter! 

<u>Journals</u>: Journaling has always been important in our family. The Lord gave me the verse below when I asked what He was thinking when He created me: 

“Then the Lord replied: ‘Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald may run with it. For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.’” Habakkuk 2:2–3

He loves it when we write down His words to us. We’ve received many prophetic words over the years, but the words He gives directly create living testimonies that outshine them all. We rest in together and ask Him to show us when their season has arrived. Together, we seek Him for daily bread for those precious words. 

Another thing we journal about is dreams. I’m in awe of how many times the kids have dreams that are connected to each other. By journaling them, we can put pieces together, and we have a record to refer back to. Our kids have had incredible dreams, and they are filled with treasures and even direction for our family. 

KEY

To reach wholeness, we must unify as a family and pursue our Father’s will for Love. Family is a place where we learn to fight for each other instead of against each other. When we learn to build a house, we learn to build a covenant that isn’t brick and stone but in our hearts.

Chapter Seventeen 

Adult Destiny 

“Abram believed the Lord, and He credited it to him as righteousness.” Genesis 15:6 

Our Father created the known universe for the purpose of love. But for love to exist as He defined it, those that He loves must have the freedom to choose and faith to believe so they can truly love Him back. Our Father has revealed love to be a choice without any influence from fear. Of all of Noah’s descendants, the Lord saw His own heart in Abram, who became Abraham. Abram believed God and chose the Father as his one and only God. The Lord counted this choice and especially his belief, despite the culture of the people around him, as righteousness. 

“By Myself I have sworn, declares the Lord, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son, indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies. In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.” Genesis 22:16–18 (NASB) 

When called to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, Abraham’s trust in the Lord became a crucial example of the quality of his belief. His faith was tested and proven to be pure and solid. His costly choice triggered the release of every benefit (favor, blessing, etc.) that the Lord has sewn into creation for every time Love is

chosen. Our Father entered into covenant with Abraham to bless his offspring. This covenant was renewed through the lines of Isaac, Jacob, and his twelve sons.

“The Lord said, ‘I have indeed seen the misery of My people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.’” Exodus 3:7 

The Israelites didn’t become the Lord’s people through the blood of goats and lambs. It was through the choices of their forefathers they received that inheritance. Belief is at the foundation of every covenant of the Lord. He looks at our hearts to see what choices we will make, whether of Love or not-Love. He looks at our faithfulness, which is a natural fruit of belief. God’s pattern of relationship always starts with us making a freewill choice to believe in Him.

JESUS

“For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.” John 3:16

Jesus is the gate through which all enter covenant with the Father. In His own words, Jesus extended this covenant to “whoever believes,” indicating both who and how. The covenant is made through belief and is extended to all persons, Jews and Gentiles. This simple truth has been received and then rejected over and over again by Christian churches. Yet, it’s imperative that every human alive recognize and receive this good news. Eternal life is salvation from the second death. The only prerequisite is belief in Jesus Christ as Savior. 

“For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.” Romans 10:10 

Through Jesus, our Father has maintained Love; both freedom of choice and faith are sown into the covenant of salvation. We must choose what we believe, and it’s not right to say that tradition overrides choice. Every human adult has the irrevocable freedom to choose what they believe. It takes faith to believe in

Jesus, as there is significant uncertainty when choosing to be rescued by a man we’re told lived two millennia ago and in every record, was doubted by those in authority. Still, when we freely choose to believe in Jesus as Savior, as an act of faith, we’re choosing Love. That simple choice leads to eternal life!

“‘Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light.’ When He had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid Himself from them.” John 12:36 

BAPTISM 

“While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said, ‘Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.’ So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.” Acts 10:44–48 

The Lord is offering a deeper sense of intimacy to those who believe in Him than that of servants. When we first freely choose to believe in Jesus as our Savior, we’re in the Servant Covenant with God. More specifically, our service is to believe and maintain that belief. Our wages are eternal life! Yet, God is inviting us deeper into His heart. He wants our relationship to grow from servants to friends (John 15:15). From a covenant of Friendship, He wants us to enter into Inheritance as His sons and daughters (2 Cor. 6:18). Ultimately, He’s looking for a Bride. The Betrothal Covenant comes from a process of sanctification, leading to holiness, purity, and His Presence (Ps. 24:3–6). When we’re in His Presence, our relationship matures into the deeper intimacy that adult children have over servants and friends. This is why it’s so valuable to be baptized and pursue holiness. 

“Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom He promised those who love Him?” James 2:5

Christianity has often misunderstood this call to righteousness as being a prerequisite for salvation. It is not. Righteousness is a requirement for being in the Presence of God as servants so we can one day call Him “Lord” as friends, and another, call Him “Father” as sons and daughters. The prerequisite for salvation is belief. The prerequisite of intimacy is holiness that comes from the baptism of the flesh. The fruit of belief is eternal life. The fruit of intimacy is heirship, which results in us inheriting the Kingdom of God. 

“Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Him. ‘Teacher,’ they said, ‘we want You to do for us whatever we ask.’ ‘What do you want Me to do for you?’ He asked. They replied, ‘Let one of us sit at Your right and the other at Your left in Your glory.’ ‘You don’t know what you are asking,’ Jesus said. ‘Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?’” Mark 10:35–38

The baptism that Jesus entered was at the cost of His life. Jesus later told James and John (v. 39) that they would drink from this cup and be baptized as He was. However, we know that John was one of the only apostles not martyred in the early Church. That being the case, how did he drink from Jesus’ cup? Jesus lost His physical life, but John lost his self-life. Both drank from the same cup. Like Jesus, John gave up what was his to rescue his lost siblings and to receive the life our Father had for him. 

“As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as He had come on us at the beginning. Then I remembered what the Lord had said: ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ So if God gave them the same gift He gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God’s way?” Acts 11:15–17 

The Holy Spirit was originally given to the apostles as the power to forgive sins (John 20:22–23). Then, at Pentecost, the Holy Spirit filled them with fire to purify them of all unrighteousness. Our brothers had been given every tool they needed to become mature and attain the fullness of Christ. They were commissioned, empowered, and authorized by Jesus. They were given the opportunity for holiness through the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This is how we all can attain the purity our Father

has called us to and be continually set free from decay, dive deeper into the heart of God, become His sons and daughters, and then reach adulthood. 

SON OF MAN

“The crowd spoke up, ‘We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, “The Son of Man must be lifted up”? Who is this “Son of Man”?’ Then Jesus told them, ‘You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going. Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light.’” John 12:34–36a 

It’s no coincidence that Jesus referred to Himself as the “Son of Man” more often than the “Son of God.” Jesus was instructed by the Father in every word that He spoke. He knew that one day, the adult sons and daughters of God would follow Him. Jesus spoke to us through His teachings so that each Church age would receive instruction and life from His words. When He talked about the Son of Man, Jesus was describing Himself and those who would follow in His footsteps. These would be the ones who would pursue the face of God and lay down their self-lives to have God’s life flow through them. They would do every work Jesus did and greater.

Jesus was the Light of the world (John 8:12), and now we are (Matt. 5:14). While He was on the earth, Jesus was the Son (huios) of Man, and now that’s us (Rev. 12:5). Like our big brother Jesus, we did not come to judge the world but to save it. We’re called to liberate creation from the bondage of decay, which is the fruit of sin. We will dismantle the evil one’s lies and strongholds built upon the world’s sins when we forgive others with the Lamb’s blood and declare the word of their testimony. 

“In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into His presence. He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped [served] Him. His

dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and His kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.” Daniel 7:13–14 

From Daniel’s vision, there’s been a common interpretation that the statements about the “son of man” describe Jesus coming with the clouds of Heaven, partly due to the Hebrew word pelakh (hlp, H6399) being translated by a few as ‘worshiped.’ Most other translations correctly say ‘serve.’ The one “like a son of man” is given authority, glory, power, and has a dominion that lasts forever. This represents the adult sons and daughters of God together with their King, Jesus Christ:

“I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: ‘The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, for ever and ever.’” Daniel 7:15–18 (NIV 1984) 

To Daniel’s astonishment (and ours), those who gave him the meaning of the things seen in the vision indicated that this “son of man” represented the saints! This is the holy people of God! These adult sons and daughters are those spoken of in the prophecy of Revelation 12 who “did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.” They lost their self-lives to gain His life through them. 

“Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be handed over to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey Him.” Daniel 7:27 

HARVEST 

“Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with Him 144,000 who had His name and His Father’s name written on their foreheads.” Revelation 14:1

---
<p style="text-align:center;">

“I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one ‘like a son of man’ with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, ‘Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.’ So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.” Revelation 14:14–16

In Revelation 14, John clearly sees Jesus as the Lamb of God standing on Mount Zion. He doesn’t see a lamb, he sees the Lamb. John, of all people, knows Jesus when he sees Him! A few verses later (v. 14), he sees “one like a son of man” (huios) seated on the cloud with a sickle, ready for harvest. John is seeing two different people: one is Jesus, and the other is this “son of man” seated on a cloud. This second person is not Jesus but the same saints that Daniel saw! We have been given the blessed destiny of harvesting the world. 

Isn’t it wonderful that the “son of man” holds a sickle meant for harvest? That means we’re dismantling the spiritual kingdom of this world, which is a very good thing. We’re dismantling the deception that causes people to choose between a menu of lies instead of Love or not-Love. As these obstacles are demolished, the Lord will intervene with Truth. Many will see the Truth and freely choose Love. We also get to rescue our kidnapped siblings and see the redemption of the Lord! Still, there is one huge variable: how many people will be harvested? Only the Father knows that answer because it depends on the free choices made by the world to receive the Truth and reject the deceptions of the evil one. 

“At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.” Matthew 24:30–31 (NIV 1984)

JUDGMENT

“If anyone hears My words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. There is a judge for the one who rejects Me and does not accept My words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.” John 12:47–48 

Who is this judge for the one who rejects Jesus? Jesus is clear that this is not Himself. Perhaps it will be the Father. That would be an excellent possibility. The books of the prophets are filled with quotations about God making judgments, but is it possible that our Father has a bigger plan? Is it possible that as Father, He wants to give His adult sons and daughters the Kingdom as an inheritance? Jesus Himself said that the judge is the one who seeks His glory and obeys His words (John 8:50–51). 

“Or do you not know that the Lord’s people will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases? Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!” 1 Corinthians 6:2–3 

The adult sons and daughters of God, like Jesus, have come to Earth not to judge but to rescue the lost. However, one day, we will be called to judge. This is why we must be sanctified through yielding daily to our Father’s will as He shines His Light in our lives. We must see hidden sins and wash them as royal priests with the blood of Jesus. We must hurl down the accuser with the testimony that comes from being forgiven by His blood. 

“‘When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on His right and the goats on His left. Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by My Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.’” Matthew 25:31–34

The story of the sheep and goats is well known among Christians. In it, we see the Son of Man separate people one from another. What we realize now is that we are not the ones being judged; we are within this Son of Man who judges. We’re separating those who are in covenant with the Father through their belief in Jesus as Savior from those who are not. The goats are those who reject Jesus and do not love. As Jesus promised, there is one who will judge: the holy people of God, as kings, and their Groom, Jesus, the King of kings. 

HEAVEN 

“And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ‘Look! God’s dwelling place [the Tabernacle] is now among the people, and He will dwell with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God. “He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death” or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.’” Revelation 21:3–4 

Heaven is like the old tabernacle (the tent of meeting) and Solomon’s temple: there is an outer court, an inner court, and the holiest of holies. Jesus said that those who believe will have eternal life (John 3:16). That belief is the front door for entering the outer courts. Entering the inner courts calls for faith that produces fruit (Matt. 25:30), living a life of pursuing the Father’s will (Matt. 7:21), and having the proper wedding garments of righteousness (Matt. 22:12). Those who do not will be forbidden from entering the Holy City (Ezek. 44:15–16, Rev. 21:24–27, 22:14–15).

KEY 

Salvation is free and comes from a single choice: belief and confession of Jesus as Savior. Beyond that, there is a deeper intimacy with God that reveals our identity as God’s children. When brought to maturity, these children will share with Jesus the inheritance of ruling the Kingdom forever.

Chapter Eighteen 

Foes 

“You armed me with strength for battle; You made my adversaries bow at my feet. You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.” 2 Samuel 22:40–41 (NIV 1984) 

The idea that we’re at war is very real, but it’s not meant to be a call to violence, even spiritual violence. In past eras of the Church, warfare meant an emotional confrontation with evil by using the first level of our authority: the name of Jesus. In the corporate adulthood of the Church, we’re operating out of the second level of our authority: hurling down the accuser with the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. Instead of facing evil head-on, we strip it of its power and authority by turning to God and loving those whose sins empowered evil in the first place. We are growing into the third level of authority: the anointing of fire that’s unstoppable. 

We have everything we need to dismantle the kingdom of darkness and win this war. The entire foundation that kingdom rests on is a deception we’ve been commissioned, authorized, and empowered to dismantle. The biggest challenge to a complete victory (an empty hell) is the side effects of the inherent free will of the world’s population. As long as there are people who freely choose to sin, demons receive power and

 authority. The good news is we have the advantage in all things, and when we ask the Lord to intervene in people’s lives, He will bring them Truth. Yet, they must still choose to let go of short- term pleasure and comfort for the reality of eternal Love. 
 
 The time is now short, and the end times are upon us. We must not be ignorant of the diabolical plans designed against us. For too long, we’ve been unaware of the advanced strategy made to defeat God’s people. Our foes surround us, and their intentions are not good. In fact, they’re not-Love! It is selfishness in which there is no good at all. The people of God, those true to the house of David, must prepare themselves for the days ahead. We must lay down our lives every day, not loving them so much as to shrink from death. We must never hide in the darkness but always remain in the Light. We must yield to daily bread and be prepared to dismantle when called. We must trust the One who sent us, to be Faithful and True as the clouds darken above us. 
 
 HISTORY 
 
 The objective of the kingdom of darkness is to defeat Love, so that their kingdom will last forever. To this end, all their schemes revolve around keeping the Bride from ever maturing and becoming old enough to marry Jesus, thereby preventing a day of judgment; this is their defensive strategy. They also work night and day to tempt humans into sin through deception to bring a continuous flow of power and authority into their kingdom, which is their offensive strategy. 
 
 For Love to be real, choice must exist. For choice to exist, there must be an alternative to Love. The enemy works to take advantage of this requirement that not-Love (selfishness) be an option. Likewise, not-Love must have the possibility of prevailing. Because of this, the evil ones spend their time attempting to win. 
 
 The kingdom of darkness has been building itself up for a long time. However, the events of the resurrection of Jesus Christ were so traumatic to them that it took hundreds of years to recover. The early followers of the Way were powerful. They operated in signs, wonders, and great miracles. They were willing to die for the Truth of the Gospel. This threat was too

vast and immediate for the kingdom of darkness. They had to respond quickly and effectively to stem the tide. It was a close call for them, but ultimately, they found a winning solution: they decided to promote the religion of Christianity. 

“I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—which is really no gospel at all.” Galatians 1:6–7a 

While this meant they were admitting a form of defeat, it also allowed the two primary objectives of the enemy to continue: preventing the Bride from maturing and gaining power and authority through sin. Religion places control (fear) over people to keep them from taking risks that allow the Church to mature. It also intermingles truth with lies to bring the defilement of idolatry (e.g., Easter, Yule logs, etc). This strategy became a huge line of defense for the enemy. It allowed them to regroup, sit, and wait out the storm. 

As the years went by, the Christian religion grew stronger in the fabric of society as an affront to the names of Yahweh and Jesus. Leaders in the religion were plagued with sins of pride, jealousy, power, pleasure, lust, hatred, fear, anger, and control. From these weaknesses, many people were savagely abused, including pagans, Jews, and even the members of the religion. It wasn’t long before the blatant hypocrisy of these leaders led to the resentment of many people, who eventually came into positions of influence and power within the world’s nations.

Eventually, a movement began to spread across society, where intellectuals began to look for something real to replace the lifeless, powerless religion of Christianity. Demons were gladly waiting to assist in any way they could and began leading these people in the direction of ancient history. Through this, some scholars began studying mysticism and hearing stories of supernatural ways. Occultists such as John Dee started calling on angels. What he got were fallen angels, who appeared with advanced knowledge. These sorts of encounters greatly intrigued men like this. These demons produced supernatural displays that got their full attention. They were reasonable beings and open to negotiation.

THE EXCHANGE 

“The devil led Him up to a high place and showed Him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And he said to Him, ‘I will give You all their authority and splendor, for it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. So if You worship me, it will all be Yours.’ Jesus answered, ‘It is written: “Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.”’” Luke 4:5–8 (NIV 1984) 

Jesus was tempted three times in the book of Luke. The first temptation was to use His power for His will done instead of His Father’s. Jesus saw through this lie and rebuked it by quoting Scripture that demonstrated a greater understanding. The third was a temptation to validate His sonship by throwing Himself off of a cliff so angels would prove His identity by rescuing Him. Jesus saw through this lie and rebuked it by quoting Scripture that says we don’t operate outside of the Father’s will. 

“Then they said, ‘Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.’” Genesis 11:4 (NIV 1984) 

Circling back to the second temptation, satan offered Jesus an exchange, a deal. First, he took Him to a high place. From this lofty position, satan, like the builders of the tower of Babel, seeks to make a name for himself. The question that led to satan’s original downfall from Heaven was, “What is in this for me?” In an attempt to get Jesus to ask the same thing, he used supernatural power to show Him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant. Everything satan said to Jesus in verses 6–7 was true: satan was given all of the power and authority of the world’s kingdoms when Adam sinned, and he did have the ability to assign this to anyone. The intentional flaw in satan’s offer was that he omitted some extremely important information. 

The exchange offered to Jesus was to give satan the sin of defilement known as idolatry, and then satan would give Jesus all the power and authority of the world’s kingdoms. What satan failed to mention was that these kingdoms (made from not-Love) are decaying to death and are, therefore, temporary. The Kingdom of God (Love) was created to last forever and, thus,

was the better choice. Jesus was forerunning the
decision that all of mankind must ultimately make: will we make
allegiance to that which brings “me” temporary glory followed
by eternal death or that which brings “our family” temporary loss
followed by eternal life.

This same offer of exchange has been presented to the world
since the flood. Demons have been presenting themselves to
humans, offering them power, authority, and knowledge in
exchange for sins of defilement (bloodshed, broken covenant,
idolatry, and sexual immorality). Demons especially target
humans for their irrevocable destinies. People with great power
(gifting in the supernatural) are targeted for wicca, satanism, and
pagan religions (new age). People with great authority (royal
blood lines) are given offers of great wealth, fame, and power.
Those with great favor are given offers of knowledge. The trade
is simple, give demons the sins that they want, and they will
provide the supernatural.

THE BACKUP PLAN

“The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the
work of satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs
and wonders.” 2 Thessalonians 2:9

Between the 1500’s and the present, the kingdom of darkness has
been actively working to complete their plan of taking over.
They kept the Christians in the dark, lying to them without
ceasing. The intellectuals that studied the mystics eventually
traded sins of defilement for knowledge, wisdom, and power.
They gave themselves to evil for the higher inheritance of evil.
They joined with each other and rose to power. They made laws,
they enforced laws, and they judged the violators. They became
leaders of great nations. They took over the money supply and
created a world system of debt where every nation was not truly
sovereign, but actually bankrupt corporations whose citizens
were in effect indentured servants.

Those with the greater spiritual gifts of authority, especially
those of royal, were targeted and enlisted for service in primary
markets of the kingdom of darkness. They willingly had sex
with demons, intermingling their DNA with that of fallen angels.

They committed their bloodlines to satan and his kingdom in exchange for the power, authority, and knowledge to rule. These dedicated descendants were sons of satan (Matt. 13:38–39). They entered into covenant first as servants, then friends, heirs, and finally, in betrothal to the evil one. Together, their kingdom of demons and half-human pawns (nephilim) built a web of deception, teaching “religious fools” that they were free when, really, they were deep in the bondage of that world system. 

The plan was easy. They would eventually drive the voting masses within nations to fight over two candidates, both of whom were chosen by the false kingdom. No matter what choice was made, they would win. When the sons of satan had control of most governments and economies, they only had to begin the process of slowly killing off the children of God to ensure their kingdom would last forever. They began to taint the food supply. They invented wars out of peace to fuel the growing fear among the populous. They promoted witchcraft called pharmaceuticals (Greek: pharmakeia) to make the sick sicker. They passed laws to deal with those who fell under a new definition of “traitor,” who represented a threat the populace had been taught to fear. They created a system of mass imprisonment and annihilation for these criminals. The trap was set. It was all ready to go, and then: 

“Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Messiah [Christ].” Revelation 12:10b 

One day, without warning, the Church grew up. People around the world gave up their lives for the truth of Jesus. They did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death. When this happened, the Lord released the Keys to the Kingdom of God. The sons and daughters of God were given the power and authority to dismantle the deception the evil one had spread across the earth. We could suddenly strip evil of its power and authority and put it back in the hands of the Church. 

It’s safe to say that satan knew that this could happen, but he most likely believed that it wouldn’t. In many respects, it was a shock to the kingdom of darkness. Well-placed plans that were certain to work began to fail, unexpectedly and without a solid

explanation why. Valid accusations that satan has brought before God’s throne for thousands of years suddenly became null and void. The children of God have learned to forgive!!! 

“Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.” Revelation 12:12 

There’s much to rejoice about concerning what we’ve received from the Lord, but there’s also much to be warned about. Never forget humans have the freedom to choose their actions. They can choose to love, or they can choose to kill innocent people at the leading of demons. With all of the power and authority we’ve been given, we still cannot override the freewill choices of the human inhabitants of the earth. 

It’s critical we become masters at dismantling evil and praying for intervention. To thwart this real threat of the enemy, God’s children must live pursuing daily bread of our Father’s will done. We must submit to the Light in our lives so we can dismantle what afflicts us and stop feeding the kingdom of darkness with our sin. From this place of humble submission, we’ll receive the anointing to become the Light of the world with the authority to hurl down the accuser with the Lamb’s blood and the word of our testimony. We can dismantle deception and then ask the Lord to intervene with Truth. When we do this, we give the world a chance to be rescued as they can finally see the Truth, maybe for the first time in their lives.

HELL ON EARTH 

The diabolical plans of diablo are without mercy. Demons will stop at nothing to avoid judgment (self-protection) while strengthening their kingdom with power, authority, and endurance (self-promotion). This is why children are butchered. This is why families are split up and imprisoned. This is why innocent blood cries out from the ground. There are many obvious examples of the enemy operating to cause harm to people. It’s the very nature of the kingdom of darkness. But there are three specific activities that epitomize hell on Earth.

---
<p style="text-align:center;">
- 227 -

</p> 
{ #p227}


---

The first is Sadistic Ritual Abuse (SRA), which we discussed in Terraforming for the Kingdom. As part of this act, there are small children (often ages five through ten) and some adults held against their will. In many cases, a group of thirteen individuals subject these children to a series of tortuous affliction, bringing fear to its highest level. There are few abuses that compare. The children are violated sexually and made to witness, and in some cases participate, in the worst of gory and violent acts. They’re forced to take part in pagan rituals and rites of passage, drink potions mixed with wine, blood, and much worse. These children are hopeless without the sons and daughters of God bringing the justice of Jesus Christ! 

The second act that epitomizes hell on Earth is human trafficking. Children and adults are being lured into captivity or directly kidnapped by a global industry that is buying and selling human beings. These victims are frightened into silence and submission through trauma and a continuous threat of injury, dismemberment, or death. In the rare instances when these prisoners are freed, it takes years of therapy to get them to a point where they can operate with some sort of normalcy again. This is another prime example of where God’s children have been given the commission, power, and authority to dismantle the works of the evil one. By walking a victim through their daily bread of the Light of God, each root sin is exposed and each trauma in need of healing revealed. When those who sinned are forgiven and the accuser is hurled down, these people can enter into rest and recovery in days, not years. How can we resist sprinting to the rescue of every one of these that the Lord assigns us in our field of harvest? 

The third act occurs in mental health asylums or the psychiatric wards of hospitals. The fact that mentally ill people have a chemical imbalance that causes dramatic instability in behavior is not challenged here. These afflictions are real and must be managed. What must be recognized, however, is the demonic influence that exists over these afflictions through generational curses, the actions of the afflicted themselves, and those who have trespassed against them. Additionally, many people are forcibly incarcerated into these facilities, having committed no crime. This loophole in the justice system is a way that many healthy people have been legally kidnapped and subjected to

endless horrors in times past. All of these patients are the victims of the power and authority of the evil one, who received this right to attack through the sins of a few people.

The sons and daughters of God must rise up. We’re the only ones with the ability to free these victims. The Lord is asking us to seek Him daily, pursuing His will done on Earth as it is in Heaven. He is looking for us to yield to Him and receive our marching orders. Once we’ve submitted to the Light in our lives, we will be anointed to bring Light to others. He will show us who specifically is in our field of harvest. He will show us when the right time to dismantle something is. He will reveal hidden sins and those who committed them, thus giving evil the right to manifest. We will forgive them with the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. We will hurl down the accuser and mop up the aftermath of demonic strongholds and activity. The Lord only needs a few righteous people who say yes to Him and do what He asks. These royal priests will be sent with great power. They will change the world now and greatly affect eternity. 

KEY

The kingdom of darkness has been dealt two serious blows by the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the birth of the adulthood of His Church—but it is not defeated yet. The children of God must become masters at dismantling the deception of evil and asking our Father to intervene with Truth. Only then can the enemy be fully overcome and defeated.

Chapter Nineteen 

The Unforgivable Sin 

“And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.” Matthew 12:31–32

Among the most avoided proclamations Jesus made is that of the “unforgivable sin.” Theologians and scholars have tried to reconcile Jesus’ seemingly contradictory statement alongside the apostle Paul’s insistence that God is full of grace, mercy, and love. Without the wisdom of the priests to show us the way, many unknowing children of God have received a lie from satan that years ago, they misspoke and, in so doing, disqualified themselves from their covenant of salvation. 

As with all prophecy and many of Jesus’ words, these were meant to be interpreted in their season of fulfillment. These things are being revealed with the birth of the Church’s adulthood. The time is now!

REVELATION 13 

“The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.” Revelation 13:1 

This story continues shortly after the dragon, who is satan, is hurled down by the brethren. The dragon is angry and desperate because he knows the time is short (Rev. 12:12). From this place of urgency, the dragon returns to an early strategy that was effective. He knows that those who aren’t in covenant with the Lamb are no match for the saints and adult children of God. His own army of occult-based pawns feed off the table scraps of authority they blindly exchange with the dragon by offering him sins of defilement. The saints have Heaven’s armies and the Holy Spirit of God within them. It’s not an even match. 

No, the dragon understands that he must pull out all the stops and focus his warfare through the same part of his kingdom that killed Jesus. The dragon will gather all his resources into a strategy that has a chance to defeat the saints, those who keep God’s commands and hold fast to their testimony of Jesus (Rev. 12:17). Satan must prioritize manipulating those who are in a covenant with a religion about Jesus instead of being in covenant with Jesus; these are people under the sway of the demon of religion. When anything becomes a source other than God, it becomes an idol, and the enemy gains authority over it. The beast—and the kingdom of selfishness’ greatest hope—is a church made of people who live for themselves and not for Love. Their unholy city is Babylon. 

“The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.” Revelation 13:2 The dragon learned two thousand years ago that it’s better to have a planet full of Christians, in covenant with a religion, than a growing family of maturing sons and daughters of God. If religion is man’s attempt to define and control God, then they enter into covenant to preserve themselves. The dragon has

called himself the father of the beast, and its followers are his sons (Matt. 13:38–39). He will place all of his power, his authority, and his throne in the hands of the beast that it might win the race of converting the world. As with all humans, the religious have irrevocable gifts that are theirs, even if they use them for their own will instead of the Father’s. Because they’re in covenant with the religion, they believe they’re in covenant with Jesus. Unfortunately, unless they know and believe in the King, He will not know or believe in them (Matt. 7:21–23). 

“Rescue me from the mouth of the lions; save me from the horns of the wild oxen.” Psalm 22:21 

“But David said to Saul, ‘Your servant has been keeping his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.’” 1 Samuel 17:34–37a

The house of David (the saints) is coming to rescue the sheep of the Lord’s flock. The sheep are the prey of Saul’s house. The house of Saul are those that speak in the name of the Lord but live for their own will to be done. They follow the religion, but the father of religion is satan. The evil one wants to use the irrevocable gifts of the religious to defeat the house of David in a race for who will receive the flocks of the Lord. The enemy wants to build an empire of religion that satan is the ultimate ruler of. 

“One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast. People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, ‘Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?’” Revelation 13:3–4

Many will be deceived by false signs and wonders coming from the beast (Matt. 24:24). The evil one has no issue with people converting to a religion, even if it uses the name of Jesus, as long as they stay in covenant with religion. Because of this, there will be people who want to do God’s will but will unknowingly do the will of satan. This can happen when a person blesses impure personalities that have grown on top of a splintered part of their soul. The wounded part of their heart requires a sign or wonder before they’ll believe. They need proof. They refuse to believe in God with faith and do not rest with the Lord in an intimate relationship. They are sitting ducks for deception.

“The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months. It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander His name and His dwelling place and those who live in heaven.” Revelation 13:5–6 

There are three targets of the beast’s blasphemy and slander. The first is God. God’s name is maligned when people operating under it make choices for their own will to be done, as a result of satan’s deception. Their irrevocable gifts still operate with anointing because they’ve accepted their irrevocable calling. The problem is that they’re seeking their own will. This contamination of selfishness is detestable in the sight of God. The beast will use this defilement to lure sheep away from the true shepherd and to the “paw of the bear.” 

“If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ. But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.” Romans 8:9b–10 

The second recipient of the beast’s blasphemy and slander is the dwelling place of God, His Temple, which is the saints (1 Cor. 3:16), who are filled with the Spirit of Christ. These are the ones in covenant with the living God and not a religion. They have spent time with Him and have learned to hear His voice. They pursue their daily bread of His will done. They did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death, so lost their self-life to receive His life for them. The beast will attack them as heretics and falsely accuse them using slivers of truth alongside

extensive and elaborate infrastructures of deception. The enemy will try to discredit the saints to keep Love from spreading across the earth. 

The third target of the beast’s blasphemy and slander are those who live in Heaven. This includes members of the cloud of witnesses who’ve gone before us. The beast will specifically slander the old wineskin instead of blessing it. The foundation of maturity that the adult children of God stand upon will be attacked with lies to cut them off at their knees. The previous generations who sacrificed their self-lives for the life God has will be slandered to further distance the sheep from the Truth. 

“[The beast] was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation. All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.” Revelation 13:7–8 

This passage does not say that the beast will conquer God’s holy people. It says that the beast is given power to conquer, which is represented as an opportunity, not a fact that it will be victorious. In other words, all humans still have the free will to choose. Everyone can make choices that determine whether they’ll be a part of the house of David or Saul. It’s not over yet. The saints must endure to the end and stay true to all that the Lord speaks over them. We must stay focused on His wonderful face until the end. 

Those who die not knowing Jesus directly (John 5:39–40) and blaspheme and slander God, His saints, and the cloud of witnesses will have blasphemed the Holy Spirit. They have committed an unforgivable sin. Their covenant is with religion and not the living God. Without a covenant with God, their names won’t be written in the Lamb’s Book of Life. In Matthew 12, Jesus was prophesying this to those in covenant with religion (Pharisees) to clarify the end-time ramifications of using God’s name in vain. The end times are now.

“Whoever has ears, let them hear. ‘If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed.’ This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people.” Revelation 13:9–10 

Always remember, our greatest weapon is Love and forgiveness. Yet, we aren’t wielding them wildly without aim. Our Father has called us to rest in Him by yielding to daily bread portions of His will done. As we do, He will show us our fields of harvest. He will reveal the hidden sins that give evil the right to occupy creation. He will reveal hidden treasures and destinies. We’ll forgive those who’ve sinned with the blood of the Lamb, and with the spoken word of our testimony, we’ll hurl down accusations granting the enemy legal rights. As we dismantle deceptions, we’ll ask the Lord to intervene with Truth. Through this, God’s children will see the greatest harvest in history! How many people say yes remains to be seen. 

THE WOMAN

“One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, ‘Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits by many waters. With her the kings of the earth committed adultery, and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.’ Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. The name written on her forehead was a mystery: BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES, AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy people, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus.” Revelation 17:1–6 

The Greek word here for ‘woman’ is gune (G1135), which refers specifically to a woman of any age who is betrothed. She is the city of Babylon, the false counterpart of the Holy City of Jerusalem. Babylon represents those betrothed to satan, who is

betrothed. She is the city of babylon that is the false counterpart
of the Holy City of Jerusalem. Babylon is betrothed to religion,
which is the beast that she rides upon. The city contains the
people of the house of saul who believe that they are in covenant
with Jesus and will call him Lord on the day of judgment, but
Jesus will not know them because they did not enter His
covenant (Matthew 7:21-23). They have betrayed their King by
preserving their self-lives, rendering them useless to the
Kingdom of Love.

“They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, the time is
coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering
a service to God. They will do such things because they have not
known the Father or me.” John 16:2-3

The same Greek word gune is used to describe the Lamb’s bride
just before their wedding (Revelation 19:7). Babylon will
attempt to win the war by murdering the saints to prevent the
children of God from ever becoming old enough to marry Jesus.
The beast, which is controlled by satan, will convince those in its
covenant that the saints are heretics who must be stopped. They
will be enlisted to hunt down their brothers to wipe them off the
face of the earth, thinking that in doing so, they are serving God!
The plan of satan is simple, without a bride, there can be no
judgment that ends the rule of his kingdom.

KEY

What theologians call “The Unforgivable Sin” was a prophesy
from Jesus of Revelation 13 where people have entered into
covenant with themselves (not-Love) instead of Christ Himself
(Love). Without repentance, they will produce the fruits of the
beast which are blasphemes against God and the cloud of
witnesses, and especially against the Spirit of Christ that is
within the saints. These sins will not be forgiven in this age or
the one to come.

Chapter Twenty 

144,000

“‘Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.’ Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.” Revelation 7:3–4 

On Saturday, March 26, 2011, I was headed to one of our monthly Blue Flame priestly gatherings where like T’sadok, we minister to the heart of our Father. We call this time of praise, worship, and adoration “Blow Pappa’s Socks Off,” or BPSO, for short. While driving, I noticed a car in front of me with the license plate “144DUQ.” Immediately, the Lord said to me, “144,000, Do U Qualify?” I inquired of the Lord and strongly felt this was a jigsaw puzzle piece I needed to hold onto; God would bring a greater understanding as the bigger picture was revealed. 

That evening, while we were hugging and welcoming each other at BPSO, I learned that a person in attendance had received a message from the Lord but was uncertain as to the interpretation. They asked if I would hear it, and I responded that, of course, I would. They told me that the Lord had told them, “The 144,000 are about to descend.” I was utterly blown away. Within a few hours, I received a confirmation about what the Lord had said to me in the car.

In Revelation 7:3–8, we read that from 144,000 servants of God, there will be twelve thousand representatives from each of Israel’s twelve tribes. This raises the question: does this number only come from the Jews and not the Gentiles? We won’t be spending much time on which of the tribes modern Jews descend from, but we can agree that ten tribes were taken “from Solomon’s hand” and kingdom (1 Kings 11:31–35). These tribes have descendants with DNA that’s likely intermingled with peoples around the world. Additionally, it’s important to note that the Lord has shown that He honors covenant over DNA. He demonstrated this through Rahab, the prostitute from Jericho (a possible foremother of the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel), as well as Ruth the Moabite. Both women were foremothers of King David and Jesus Himself (Matt. 1:5–6)! We also know that in the book of Revelation, it’s ideal not to take everything written in it literally; for example, women don’t generally give birth to adult sons. Ultimately, we can rest in knowing that in these verses, the Lord is revealing a royal remnant of His people. 

TRAITS OF THE 144,000 

“These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever He goes.” Revelation 14:4a 

How can we narrow down who these 144,000 are? John writes that they did not defile themselves with women by remaining virgins. Does this mean literally never marrying? Is this an indication that females are an inferior gender in the Kingdom? No, the word for ‘woman’ here is gune (G1135), which in ancient Greek, was a betrothed woman. This same word is used in the description of Babylon the prostitute (Rev. 17:3), who is the portion of Christianity that entered into covenant with the beast (Rev. 13). The beast is the demon of the religion of Christianity and teaches selfishness instead of selfless Love.

“Jesus answered, ‘If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.’” Matthew 19:21

The 144,000 are not exclusively males who avoided marriage. They’re a remnant of God’s people (sons and daughters) who chose to pursue intimacy with the Lord (Ps. 24:3–6), yielded their lives to daily bread portions of His will done (Matt. 6:10– 11), and chose to die daily (Luke 9:23–24). They gave up their lives and follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These are not a sinless people. They simply have chosen to enter covenant with the Lamb and have qualified for the wedding.

“They were purchased from among men [mankind] and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb.” Revelation 14:4b 

Secondly, we’re told that the 144,000 were purchased from among humanity. Saul, who was renamed Paul by Jesus and became a great apostle to the Church, was purchased in this way. The purchase price was the innocent blood of a martyr named Stephen (Acts 7:58). Through his death, our Lord was able to intervene in the life of Saul on the road to Damascus. There, Jesus appeared to Saul and renamed and commissioned him to lead both Jews and Gentiles to the Light of God. The 144,000 will also be purchased in such a way that the Lord will intervene in their lives. Like theater ushers with Light, they will guide a multitude to their seats in the greatest harvest in history. 

Thirdly, the 144,000 are offered as first fruits. In modern vernacular, these sons and daughters are firstborn children in the spirit, with an anointing to prepare the way for others to follow. They will be the first to overcome the power of selfishness (not-Love) by their choice to deny themselves. They will rest in the will of their Father. They will put all of their fears, anger, control, rebellion, addictions, self-protection, self-absorption, self-sourcing, and ambition on the altar. In exchange, they will receive the life their Father planned for them, which is exceedingly good. The fruit is what eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor mind conceived (1 Cor. 2:9). It is the most advantageous trade available in all creation. 

“No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.” Revelation 14:5

The 144,000 are Levitical priests. They are described the same way that Malachi described Levi when he said, “Nothing false was found on his lips” (Mal. 2:4–6). Yet, being Levites is impossible if they’re from all twelve tribes of Israel. This could only occur if these sons and daughters, Jews or Gentiles, enter Jesus’ covenant and choose to be God’s children. Then, they carry Jesus’ priestly mantle in the order of Melchizedek (Heb. 7:14–17). They become kings and priests (Rev. 5:10), a chosen generation and royal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9). 

“I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.” Revelation 20:4–6 

The 144,000 are from the spiritual church of Laodicea. They overcame and were given the right to sit with Jesus on His throne (Rev. 3:21), where they will judge the world (1 Cor. 6:2). They were not “beheaded” once but every day as they took up their cross, denied themselves, and lost their lives (Luke 9:23–24). They did not become one flesh with Babylon, the woman (gune) who entered into covenant with the beast (demon of religion). Their daily death and resurrection are first because they are the first-fruits offering. They will be priests of God and Christ and will reign as kings under the King of kings for a thousand years. 

“In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian will come into Egypt and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians will serve with the Assyrians. In that day Israel will be one of three with Egypt and Assyria—a blessing in the midst of the land, whom the Lord of hosts shall bless, saying, ‘Blessed is Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance.’” Isaiah 19:23–25 (NKJV)

Is the number 144,000 an exact number of people? Since 2008, we’ve told the story many times of how the Lord told us about the sons of T’sadok and to pay attention to the number forty-four. Right after that, He highlighted US interstate highway I-44 that runs from Texas through Oklahoma to Missouri. The Lord gave us a parallel to Isaiah 19 and the feasts: Texas is Egypt, Oklahoma is Israel, and Missouri is Assyria. In that case, Texas is “His people” (Pesach/Passover), Missouri is “His handiwork” (Shavuot/Pentecost), and Oklahoma is “His inheritance” (Sukkot/Tabernacles). We felt strongly that this was a representation of the 144,000 but not exclusive to the people from these areas. The number 144,000 signifies royal government (12x12). The number represents all the adult children of God who’ve yielded their lives to His will done. 

The 144,000 are about to descend. They will soon drop from a higher spiritual altitude to a lower one. The Lord has called them high on His holy mountain, where they’re able to go because of their clean hands and pure hearts (Ps. 24:3–6). When they descend, it will be for a final mission, a culmination of their calling. They learned how to rescue while getting their stolen siblings back. Now, they are being sent to get family members who by covenant, are as numerous as the sand on the seashore. 

THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST 

“Those great beasts, which are four, are four kings which arise out of the earth.” Daniel 7:17 The Lord has used the picture of beasts coming from the earth several times in prophecy, especially in the book of Daniel and Revelation. When depicted as ‘kings’ or ‘kingdoms,’ most theologians look to nations or specific people on the earth. They focus on trying to find which best fits the prophecy’s description to uncover a brilliant interpretation. However, the Lord wants us to receive our revelation directly from Him. 

The kings being described in these verses are humans created with an irrevocable calling to become God’s adult sons and daughters, kings and priests. They’re called beasts because they’ve exchanged their irrevocable favor from God with demons for the satisfaction of themselves (power, authority,

protection, influence, etc.). They’re in covenant with demons for their own glory (not-Love), yet, they still think they’re in covenant with God. 

“Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon. He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.” Revelation 13:11–15 (NIV 1984) 

The first beast came out of the sea. It is a demonic structure: the religion of Christianity that lures people into a false covenant with it instead of Jesus. The second beast comes from the earth. This is a structure of man, a byproduct of a one-flesh covenant between people and the demon of the religion of Christianity. These people will perform miracles, signs, and wonders in Jesus’ name, yet won’t be in covenant with God through Jesus (Matt. 7:21–23). They will believe these miracles are the fruit of their covenant with God, but they are not. You can tell the difference by their fruit (Matt. 7:17): The beast can only produce miracles. The saints, the adult sons and daughters of God, produce the fruit of repentance in the hearts of many (Matt. 11:20–24). This simply means that the Love and Truth of God that comes from the Holy Spirit is seen in the saints. It will touch people’s hearts in a way that encourages them to change their minds about selfishness and turn to the righteousness of selfless Love. 

“He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man’s number. His number is 666.” Revelation 13:16–18 (NIV 1984)

The number of the beast will be marked on the right hand or forehead of those who agree to it. Many have a misunderstanding that this mark is made on top of the hand, but it actually goes on the palm. A cut or mark on the palm is also the mark of covenant that God has with His people (Isa. 49:15– 16). This is not a literal mark! It’s a sign of covenant. The second beast, which is a structure of man, will insist that all enter into covenant with the first beast, which is a demonic structure. 

“Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.” Revelation 7:3 (NIV 1984) 

The sons and daughters of God who overcome have Jesus’ name imprinted on their foreheads. They follow the Lamb wherever He goes. They choose selflessness when it is easier to be selfish. They dismantle evil’s power and authority to bring decay, both in their lives and the portions of creation the Father sends them to. They release God’s purpose everywhere they go. 

The emissaries of not-Love are unable to establish their own kingdom. They need the freewill choices of humans to be selfish for their kingdom to win dominion. Thus, we can call this kingdom “of man.” The fruit of man’s kingdom is the first beast from the sea (religion of Christianity) and the second beast from the earth (man’s structure). While we baptize in one name of God with three manifestations: Father, Spirit, and Son (Matt. 28:19). The second beast brings an imitation: three 6s (man’s number), or 666. 

“A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: ‘If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on the forehead or on their hand, they, too, will drink of the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of His wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.’ This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who keep His commands and remain faithful to Jesus.” Revelation 14:9–12

The covenants being described in Revelation are one-flesh covenants. Those who have Jesus’ name on their foreheads are one flesh with Him. They receive His reward: eternal life in the Kingdom. Those who have the name of the beast on their foreheads and its cut of covenant on their palm are one flesh with the beast. They will receive the reward of serving the beast: torment in a burning lake of sulfur whose smoke rises forever and ever. 

The stakes are high. It will be better to be cold than lukewarm. We must yield to the Father. He has a plan for rescuing our siblings. It’s crucial that we overcome so our family can be rescued! The Father is not willing that any should be lost!

THE GREAT MULTITUDE 

“After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb.” Revelation 7:9a (NIV 1984) 

The 144,000 will prepare the way for the sickle to be swung from the cloud in Heaven across the earth in a worldwide harvest (Rev. 14:14–16). They are the end-time army the prophet Joel foretold (Joel 2:2). The great multitude of Revelation 7 is the result of this harvest. They are certainly a large number, but not yet one that can be fully counted. The freewill choices of those who will be harvested haven’t been made yet and cannot be spoken. Only the Father knows their number. Every person will be given the ability to choose whether to accept their covenant with God. They’re given the invitation of salvation to become servants of God and of purity so they can become friends of God. They can also give up their lives to become sons and daughters. If they choose to die daily, they will follow the Lamb and grow up, making them a part of the Bride. 

“Then one of the elders asked me, ‘These in white robes—who are they, and where did they come from?’ I answered, ‘Sir, you know.’ And he said, ‘These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.’” Revelation 7:13–14

Those in the great multitude will be taught that as God’s children, they have the authority to hurl down the accuser with the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. The 144,000 will instruct them to defeat evil in their lives through Love as they apply the fullness of God’s forgiveness. Through Jesus’ blood, they are purchased from every tribe, nation, and language and prepare themselves to be released into their irrevocable callings as kings and priests (Rev. 5:9–10). 

“Therefore, ‘they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will spread His tent over them. Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat upon them, nor any scorching heat. For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; He will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’” Revelation 7:15–17 (NIV 1984)

The great multitude consists of priests in the order of T’sadok, for only the sons of T’sadok will be permitted to stand and minister before the Lord. Only they can enter His sanctuary and guard His Presence (Ezek. 44:15). They overcame and are called sons and daughters (Rev. 21:7). They chose to lay down their selfishness and, in return, became children of Love.

THE CALL 

“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.” Matthew 5:17–18 

Jesus taught us how to know when everything is accomplished: when we see Heaven and Earth disappear (Rev. 21:1). Until that time, there is a great work to be done. The 144,000 will descend from their place of intimacy with God and prepare the way for the greatest harvest ever. The great multitude will be the fruit of this harvest. Many will be saved from the second death, becoming servants, friends, and children of God.

There are many things we will see before everything is complete. The Lord will release detriment (consequences) for those who continue to make sinful, selfish choices of not-Love. This is represented as seven plagues in Rev. 16: painful sores, the death of sea life, rivers of blood, intense heat from the sun, darkness covering the kingdom of the beast, false miraculous signs, and terrible calamities (storms, earthquakes, and hail). These afflictions are the fruit of those in covenant with the demon of religion. Because they think their covenant is with God, they’ll be angry, curse, and accuse Him (verses 9–11, 21). 

Babylon’s groom, the demon of religion, will fall. The fruit of entering into covenant with a religion instead of directly with God is decay and death. It’s because of this great cost that the 144,000 are passionately on fire. They burn to rescue the brothers and sisters who’ve elevated selfish motives over yielding to the Father’s will. We must receive Heaven’s strategy for our last effort to rescue the Church. Then, we’ll be sent on the final mission of rescuing the world. 

SPEAK NOW

“Son of man, go now to the house of Israel and speak My words to them.” Ezekiel 3:4b (NIV 1984) 

The fiancé of the beast is about to marry the wrong guy. They’re beautiful people who know much about God but were deceived into believing they fully know God. Many do not. Some do, but with only a trickle of truth. The 144,000 are called to rescue them before it’s too late. Eventually, the dragon (satan) will fall completely to the earth, and in his anger, war will break out. All power and authority will be given from the dragon to the beast. 

There are many, especially in leadership, who are called to the Church’s adulthood. They’re created for this generation, where we willingly give up our old wineskin to receive the new. Yet, the evil one has schemed to entice them towards selfish pleasure: pride, power, prestige, and the promise of more. These people of God need the fullness of Christ that only comes from the Keys of the Kingdom, where strongholds are dismantled in their lives, they overcome habits, and receive the covenant truth of what God was thinking when He created them.

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p> 
{ #p248}

To this end, our Father has called us to rally the cessors, the intercessors of the new wineskin, into action. Each of us is called to pray and ask the Lord to raise up cessors with an anointing to pray for the leadership of the Church’s previous wineskin. We cannot override their free will, but we can intercede for them. When we see a leader covering themselves with a dome of inaccessibility, which often comes from pride, power, and prestige, we have the privilege of asking the Lord to raise up their new-wineskin cessors. This drought of the heart that cuts off the rains from the land must be addressed swiftly (Jude 1:12)! 

Cessors called to pray for leaders in the old wineskin will ask the Lord what He was thinking when He created them. They will speak life into their calling and pursue the covenant the Lord has made with them. In some cases, the Lord will bless us with clearance to dismantle deceptions affecting them by praying through the fullness of forgiveness. Then we ask the Lord to intervene with Truth. Our prayer is that these family members will see clearly and choose to be set free from the pollution of religion and any choices of not-Love. 

We know that we can’t take any person past their choice. We must all choose whom we will serve this day. Soon, we will go and get those who don’t know who God really is. We will take the Love of God to the lost. 

KEY 

The 144,000 servants of God in Revelation 7 and 14 are a royal government of His sons and daughters who rest on the shoulders of Jesus. They’re fathers, mothers, kings, and priests. They haven’t received the cut of one-flesh covenant with the beast of religion on their palms. Jesus’ name is on their foreheads. They’re about to descend to the Church and to the lost children of God to prepare the way for the greatest harvest of Love in history.

Chapter Twenty-One 

Casting the Net

“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.’ So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.” Matthew 22:8–10 

We are on the verge of a new mission. Our calling is about to shift from a focus on the existing family to those who will be family soon. There’s a limited time for which to prioritize rescuing people who are in covenant with the beast, which are those who believe they’re in covenant with God but are actually joined with the demon of religion. We love them with all of our hearts, but at some point, we must leave them to their own choices. Our attention will soon move to those who haven’t heard of or know the true Jesus. There will be a war to rescue these people between the Kingdom of Love and the kingdom of not-Love (Rev. 13:7,14). 

“So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, ‘Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes.’” Genesis 35:2

We all need a change of clothes. Many of us were raised under the influence of a demon of religion that perverted God’s truth. We must be set free of the parts of us that stand on a foundation of man’s understanding of God. We need the revelation of Jesus as Truth, which comes from the Father (Matt. 16:17–18). We need to receive the revelation of the Gospel that comes from Jesus Himself (Gal. 1:12). We need the knowledge of God that comes from the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:8) to replace what came from people. Equally, the message we bring to the lost must be void of any trace of religion. It must be a living testimony, anointed by God. Every person needing rescue is different but have this in common: they don’t know who God is or how real true Love can be. Our message must be void of jargon. Many of us have learned Christian language that uses Scripture (and ancient wording) instead of common language a contemporary populous would more easily understand. We need our communication to start from scratch. The following will be written as a message for those we’re called to rescue. 

THE MESSAGE: INTRODUCTION 

“Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.” 1 John 4:8 

I want to ask you to take a risk that could change your life. It’s worth it. No matter what you know about God or if you believe there even is a God, will you set that aside and hear a story? It goes like this: Before the universe existed, there was God, who is like nothing we’ve ever seen before. God has no size or shape. God is good. God is beauty. God is living Light. 

“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” 1 Corinthians 13:4–7 (NIV 1984) 

God chose to clarify the definition of love. God’s definition was a relationship of selflessness between two or more that is without condition and never-ending. With love being a relationship and God being alone, God was saying that something would need to

exist that He could love and would be capable of loving Him back. God created the universe to be the focus of His love, and within it, He released the freedom to choose so the universe could love God, too. The two foundational choices built within creation were simple: to love or not to love. God established that benefit would be the result of choices of love and detriment would be the result of choices of not-love. God became vulnerable to the universe when this occurred and even further clarified that God’s identity is Love. 

God has a master plan for Love. He realized that for the fullness of Love to be established, there needed to be something in existence worthy to be called the lover and loved of God. God created humans with the same foundational attribute He has: the power and authority to create or destroy. This, combined with the ability to choose freely, allowed human beings to dominate the universe and choose whether or not to be in a loving relationship with God. God gave humans their start as His children with dominion over the universe, and their lives began within a loving environment. They were free to choose not-Love at any point with the understanding that detriment would be the result. 

God created the universe, knowing it would not choose unconditional selflessness forever. Before humans were created, God made servants called angels. One angel, in particular, was the first to choose not-Love. The universe wasn’t changed from that one choice, but the seed of detriment was released into it. After humans were created, this angel eventually brought this seed of detriment to them as a deception. The first humans believed the deception and chose not-Love. Because humans were given dominion in creation, their choice changed the condition of the universe from Love to not-Love. The result of not-Love is detrimental, which ultimately means death, but not immediate death. The universe is decaying, and all humans live under this condition until we die. As bad as this sounds, there is good news: God still has a master plan of Love. 

THE MESSAGE: FREEDOM

“For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it.” Romans 8:20a

<p style="text-align:center;">

Every human being born today is a slave to the conditions of not- Love. We’re decaying and continue to until the day we die. We see this in many situations: cancer, multiple personality disorder, and death by “natural causes.” Before the first humans chose not-Love, the universe was driven by selflessness, but now it’s by selfishness. We see this when government officials lie, steal, kill, and destroy for their own gain. We see wars between nations and within nations often because of selfish policies that result in significant casualties. 

As a detriment of the first humans’ choice of not-Love, God’s Presence was minimized from our view. Before then, not-Love wasn’t as clearly apparent. For a tainted angel to change the universe’s conditions from benefit to detriment, humans had to believe a lie. Now, we must believe in God’s truth to see creation change from widespread detriment back to benefit. This choice of belief, despite uncertainty, is called faith. These two things are required for Love to exist: free will and faith. With these, the universe can be restored to its former state of Love. 

Not everyone has heard the name of Jesus before, but many who have were given a false idea of who He is. We want to tell you who He is and why He came. Although humans have been free to choose Love and change the universe’s condition back to benefit, fully restoring creation would take the choices of the entire human race, which God knows is impossible. God also knew that for us to be rescued from our slavery to detriment, there had to be intervention. 

God continued the master plan of Love by choosing a human woman and entrusting her to be pregnant with God’s son. God’s DNA was used to fertilize the woman’s egg, thereby restoring the DNA of Love to the world. However, the Son of God would be born with a brand new human body and mind. He was created for the purpose of paying the debt of detriment for the human race but was free to choose whether to accept this destiny or not. This Son was Jesus. No person or group of persons can be blamed for Jesus’ eventual death. He chose to die so the universe could be restored back to Love. Jesus lived a life of Love, perfect in every sense, and then freely chose to give up His life so we could regain complete access to the benefit that Love brings.

“If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” Romans 10:9 (NIV 1984) 

Through the life of Jesus, God restored our ability to better see and choose. He came to rescue us from detriment, decay, and permanent death. Free will and faith are requirements for Love; if we want what Jesus is offering, we must choose to believe in the truth of who Jesus is. If you freely choose to believe Him and declare that belief, you have entered into a covenant of Love, a relationship of commitment with God.

“For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.” John 3:16 

When a person dies, there are two basic outcomes: eternal life (benefit) or final death (detriment). If we choose Love by freely believing that Jesus has rescued us, we will receive new bodies and live forever. If we don’t, we will cease to exist. 

Love is unconditional. God has offered it to us as a free gift. No matter what you’ve been told, you don’t have to change yourself to be loved by God and, therefore, saved from permanent death. All you have to do is believe. There’s no catch, but there is more to the story. You can choose to stop here or hear more. Regardless, if you believe, you will be saved. You can declare this right now if you want. Just say, *“I choose to believe that Jesus has saved me from permanent death. Through Him, I will have eternal life.”*

THE MESSAGE: FRIENDSHIP 

*“I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from My Father I have made known to you.”* John 15:15 

If you freely choose to believe Jesus has rescued you from permanent death, you have eternal life through the covenant of Love that God has offered the world. You become a servant of God, and God becomes your master. You have little intimacy

with Him but should know you are loved forever unconditionally. As long as you believe in Jesus as your rescuer and declare this openly, you will be saved. You have that eternal promise as a servant of God. 

Is there a catch? No. Is there more? Yes! God has an amazing plan for Love. If you want more than just salvation from permanent death—if you want to see the full benefit of Love released into your life—there’s another invitation you can accept. It is an invitation of friendship. As we all know, friendship is a deeper relationship than servanthood. Servants obey commands and do not discuss personal issues. Friends spend time together, get to know one another, and share their lives in a deeper way. 

“The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend.” Exodus 33:11a (NIV 1984) 

To become a friend, we must spend time with God. This starts with the simple act of praying. Praying is when we freely choose to believe and then boldly talk to God. We believe despite the uncertainty that comes from our eyes not seeing Who we’re speaking to and our ears not hearing the replies. Praying can be as easy as telling God what you think about things. “You know what, God? I don’t like it when people lie about me, and I don’t like the taste of lima beans.” You might also ask God questions, like, “God, what do you like? What don’t you like?” 

“Who may ascend the hill of the Lord? Who may stand in His holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear by what is false. He will receive blessing from the Lord and vindication from God his Savior. Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face, O God of Jacob.” Psalm 24:3–6 (NIV 1984) 

God’s Presence is like an enormous hospital that is comfortable and peaceful (but actually smells good)! It’s a safe place for people to be healed because it’s sterile, free from the harmful impurities of decay. God is Love, and Love is not decaying.

God’s Presence must stay this way. To enter fully into it, we must be purified of pollutants that cover us as a result of being in a universe under the detrimental effects of what isn’t Love.

“We have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus.” Hebrews 10:19b 

Before we can move beyond the surface level of God’s Presence and into the deeper parts of His heart, we must be purified of the contaminants of not-Love. We must be cleaned from the selfishness we were born into. 

Jesus did not die a quick death by beheading or hanging from a rope. He was slowly beaten, whipped, and then nailed and hung from a wooden cross until He suffocated to death over many hours. The lashes on His body and the nails piercing His hands and feet caused Him to bleed. His blood is what makes us clean: 

“For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life.” Leviticus 17:11 

To become a friend of God, we must realize we were born into a universe governed by the conditions of not-Love. Not-Love is selfishness that leads to decay and ultimately, death. All of our lives, we have made choices of not-Love: self-preservation, self- sourcing (independence), self-focus, and self-promotion. The focus on self has caused us to lie, accuse, steal, and destroy. We can be fearful, angry, and controlling. We sometimes get impatient, envious, or act unkind. 

“For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.” Jeremiah 31:34b 

“Sin” is God’s word for choices of not-Love. When we choose to receive the free gift of forgiveness from God through the blood of Jesus, we’re purified from the effects of not-Love, detriment’s consequence is nullified (we are redeemed), and we are restored to a place where we can fully enter God’s Presence. Just like with our covenant of salvation, we simply choose to believe in the power of Jesus’ blood and then declare this by speaking out that testimony.

You can easily pray the testimony. It looks something like this: “God, I don’t want to make selfish choices of not-Love anymore. I receive the blood of Jesus, and I am now purified, redeemed, and restored back to You. The memory of these choices is erased.” Once you’ve prayed this, God no longer remembers your choices of not-Love. You can speak with Him deeper than at a surface level. You can spend time with Him, and He will begin to amaze you!!! 

As your friendship with God develops, you will find that He deeply loves you. You will start to see the benefit of choices with Love manifest in your life. Choices of Love occur as you continue to have faith in Jesus, believing despite uncertainty, and choose to build a relationship with God by spending time with Him. When you first receive the blood of Jesus, your whole body will be clean. However, like a person in the desert who wears sandals needs to wash their feet, we also need to be cleansed daily (John 13:10). 

“The Lord said, ‘Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by.’ Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper. When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave.” 1 Kings 19:11–13a 

The more time you spend with God, the more you’ll begin to understand His communication. God has a voice, but it’s often different than what we hear with our ears. Sometimes, a thought comes into our mind that seems random. Sometimes, we see coincidences: the same time on a clock over and over again, street signs that have the same message as a book you just read, a person who tells you something and you just can’t seem to get it out of your head. Many times, these are the gentle whispers of God. If you take a risk and believe that they are, you will begin to see that these pieces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. God is giving you a picture. This is His voice.

THE MESSAGE: CHILDREN 

“I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.” 2 Corinthians 6:18 

Friends of God have their own names and their own property. They’re invited to spend time with Him, and they’re free to accept or decline these invitations. Still, there is a deeper intimacy we can have with God. God has a master plan for Love! He wants us to become His children. It is costly. We must give up our name in order to get His. We must give up our property and live in His house with Him. We must become like little children (Matt. 18:3). 

“Jesus answered, ‘If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.’” Matthew 19:21 

To become children of God, we must give up our identity and receive His. Just like when we first received the blood of Jesus that made our whole body clean, giving up our lives starts with a single choice. The prayer is just as easy. You can say something like this, “God, I choose to accept Your invitation to become your child. I choose You as my Father. I want You to be my source of everything. I lay my life at Your feet and receive the inheritance of Your family.” 

“Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread.” Matthew 6:10b–11

Servants are commanded to eat. Friends are invited to dinner parties on occasion. Children are called to the Father’s table to eat with Him every day. We are not imposing upon Him; we are expected to come! We learned how to hear God’s voice when we were friends. Now that you’re His child, you’re ready to start pursuing daily bread of His will done. God’s will is Love’s master plan. Every day, your Father sets aside a perfect portion of His will for His children. Jesus taught us to seek God’s Love, ask for God’s Love, and knock on the door of Love, and God will open it for you (Matt. 7:7). Seek His will daily, and He will teach you how to mature as His child. Our Father’s will includes revelation, truth, freedom, healing (physical and emotional), all

provision (shelter, food, resources), and our inheritance. Pray this: “*Father, I ask You to give me my daily portion of Your will done*.”

“These are the Scriptures that testify about Me.” John 5:39b (NIV 1984) 

Now that you’ve become God’s child and have a growing relationship with Him, there’s a book you will find very helpful. The Bible contains ancient writings about God (Scripture), the good news of Jesus (Gospels), and letters written by early founders of His family. The Bible is meant to be read as a confirmation of what you know about your Father and Jesus from your direct experience with them. It can also be read prior to deeper intimacy with God, bringing great wonder as its verses come alive through experience and revelation. Many stories in Scripture (the Old Testament, original covenant) will parallel what you experience today. In the Gospels and letters (the New Testament, completion covenant), you can read stories called parables Jesus told to illustrate experiences we may have and critical guides for identifying what choices are Love or not-Love (sin). All of these things are invaluable as you enter the Father’s process of maturing to adulthood. 

THE MESSAGE: ADULT BRIDE 

“Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Him who is the Head, that is, Christ. From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.” Ephesians 4:14–16 (NIV 1984) 

Love’s master plan is for us to progress from slaves of not-Love to servants, friends, and then children of God. Our Father intends for His children to mature and grow up so we can handle the responsibilities He wants to give us. With these responsibilities, we will see things beyond our imagination (1 Cor. 2:9). The plan culminates when His adult children become one with Jesus in a wedding where we, as a Bride, marry Jesus as our Groom.

Then [Jesus] said to them all: ‘If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself and take up His cross daily and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for Me will save it.’” Luke 9:23–24 (NIV 1984) 

We gave up our lives to become His children. Now, we must do this daily if we want to follow in His steps. Jesus is the Son of God who grew up and changed the world. God’s plan is for us to do the same! Each of us has the privilege every day of giving up the part of our lives that is selfish and decaying to death. That means we chose to be set free of our selfish nature and have it replaced with God’s nature, which is Love. Pray this, “Father, I lay down my selfishness so it can die, and in its place, I ask You to resurrect the person You created me to be.” 

“This is what the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One of Israel, says: ‘In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength.’” Isaiah 30:15a 

Repentance means to change your mind, specifically from not- Love to Love. Rest is what we experience when we choose to pursue our daily portion of His will done and then yield our lives to what He shows us. Trust is when we choose to believe that what we receive each day includes our Father’s will being done. If we have any uncertainties or questions about what we experience, we get to ask Him for clarification or confirmation. He wants to hear from us! We don’t have to worry about anything. We trust Him with everything. As adults, we learn to respond as He would. Our desires begin to change from self- focus to Love. We see others’ concerns as higher than our own. When this happens, we’re starting to look like our Father. 

“God’s gifts and His call are irrevocable.” Romans 11:29 

Every individual is created with a very special design. From the beginning, our Father has had a wonderful plan for us. Some people call this “destiny,” others “a plan,” and others still “our calling.” Whatever the name, it is a reflection of our design. Some are called to lead, some to teach, some to hear and speak God’s words on Earth, and some to tell others the good news of Jesus. Some do this work in the town where they live. Others are sent to foreign lands far away

No matter what our calling is, we have the freedom to choose whether to accept it or not. Our calling leads us to Love, so it’s best to choose this destiny, but we don’t have to. We choose God’s plan when we pursue daily bread portions of our Father’s will done in our lives. When we ask Him each day to give us that portion of His goodness and then trust that He will do it, we can be assured that He’ll lead us to our call, and it will be amazing! 

God gives us gifts or special abilities so we can accomplish our call. Our Father, Jesus, and the angels live in a realm invisible to us since humanity first chose not-Love and the universe’s condition shifted toward detriment. Many people have the gift of discerning within that realm. Some can actually see things that are in it. Others can hear things, and some can feel emotions that reflect what’s happening there. 

“And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus.” Ephesians 2:6 

Humans are created with a body on the earth. We also have our mind, free will, and emotions (soul), which are less tangible than the body but very important to our being. Finally, humans have a part of our being within the realm our Father, Jesus, and the angels are. It is called our spirit. Our spirit is designed like a big container. Our Father wants to fill us up with everything that is Him!

“Again Jesus said, ‘Peace be with you! As the Father has sent Me, I am sending you.’ And with that He breathed on them and said, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.’” John 20:21–23

We now know God as our Father and Jesus, who is the Christ (our rescuer). It’s time for us to know the Holy Spirit of God. Jesus offered the Holy Spirit to His brothers and sisters when He breathed upon them. Their spirits, seated in the heavenly realm, were then filled up with the Presence of God. The Holy Spirit has seven manifestations in our lives: wisdom, understanding, counsel, power, the knowledge of God, the awe of God, and His Presence with which we interact as His children (Isa. 11:2). The

Holy Spirit is the same Spirit that was within Jesus and is the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9). When you have the Spirit of the rescuer within you, you can then become a rescuer.

“The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.” Romans 8:19–21 (NIV 1984) 

The Father sent Jesus to live a life as Love, die though innocent, and through His resurrection, rescue people from the detriment of decay and death that comes from not-Love. Jesus commissioned us to do the exact same thing. He lived emulating what we will do when we become God’s children and mature into adulthood. We are following Him. The entire universe and everything in it has been decaying as a result of the first humans’ detrimental choice of not-Love. The decay continues to this day as people continue to choose selfishness. The created universe needs to be rescued. 

The angel who first chose not-Love and deceived humans into doing the same deceived many other angels as well. They received the power and authority to bring decay into creation. Their empire of not-Love is a kingdom that will not last forever, though they think it will. Like creation, their kingdom is decaying into death. God’s master plan of Love was for a Kingdom of Love to arise. The first humans lived in that Kingdom but chose to give it up. We’re called by our Father to see this Kingdom restored, which we know will happen because our Father (who knows the future) has said so. Love is never- ending. The Kingdom of Love will prevail. We will contribute to this as we learn who we really are! 

“But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.” 1 Peter 2:9 (NIV 1984) 

The concept of “priest” is known in many parts of the world with some good connotations and some bad. The priests of God serve

<p style="text-align:center;">
- 263 -

</p> 
{ #p263}


---
our Father directly, thanking Him for what He’s done for His people, singing songs of gratitude (praise, worship) to Him, and doing everything they were instructed to do. The priests were responsible for bringing God’s forgiveness to people. Before Jesus, this required the blood of certain animals that were free of defects. Today, we have a far more powerful way of forgiving:

“For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down. They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony.” Revelation 12:10b–11a (NIV 1984) 

The angel who first deceived humans has been called by many monikers: lucifer, satan, the devil, and the accuser—to name a few. Every time a person chooses not-Love (selfishness), satan receives power and authority to bring decay to creation. The adult sons and daughters of God take away this power and authority when, as royal priests, they forgive those who chose not-Love (sin) with the blood of the Lamb (Jesus) and speak out the testimony of those forgiven. Their testimony is that they, like us all, are now purified, redeemed, and restored back to God. The memory of those sins is erased. The prayer looks something like this: *“Father, we forgive William for lying. We wash him with the blood of Jesus, and he is now purified, redeemed, and restored back to You. We hurl down the accuser, and the memory of the sin is erased.”*

“You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your presence.” Psalm 90:8 

The adult sons and daughters of God have been called with a great destiny to liberate the created universe from its bondage to decay, but not all choices of not-Love (sin) are in plain sight. Sometimes we choose to hide them. Sometimes a sin was committed by a person who lived many years ago, and there’s no record of it occurring that we can obtain. Fortunately, our Father knows all these things. When we yield to Him and pursue our daily portions of His will done, He will reveal those hidden sins in the Light of His Presence. He has called us to pray this way, *“Father, we ask You to shine Your Light. Reveal to us our daily*

portion of the hidden sins You want erased that are causing decay in the world.” 

As we do this, we also receive revelation of our Father’s original design of Love for all creation. We can then declare what He shows us and begin to see His goodness replace the decay. When enough of us participate in this daily, we will see the accuser truly hurled down, and a radical change will take place in the world as we know it! 

“They did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.” Revelation 12:11b 

Our Father’s master plan of Love culminates when the adult sons and daughters give up their lives of decaying selfishness and receive the never-ending life of selflessness designed for them. They become worthy of being called the lover and loved of God. These sons and daughters will collectively unify into one (John 17:20–23) and become a Bride for Jesus. Then, the Bride and Groom will become one in an eternal bond and life of grand adventure. We will see the fruit of goodness, joy, peace, and Love that are literally beyond the imagination!

“One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, ‘Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.’ And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.” Revelation 21:9–11 

When a person dies, their body decays into dust, but the part of them that is in the invisible realm lives on. God will have a final day when the choices of each person are examined (Rev. 20:11– 12). Those who choose to become adult sons and daughters will be a Bride to Jesus (Matt. 25:1–13, Rev. 19:6–8, 11–16). God’s children will not become one with Jesus but will live in a huge city (New Jerusalem) with their Father and the married Jesus. The friends of God who washed their robes will be invited to the wedding ceremony and will be allowed to enter the city, but their home will be outside of its gates (Rev. 21:24–26, 22:14). The

servants who chose to believe in Jesus, but never became
friends or children will life forever as servants. They will not be
allowed to enter the Kingdom City, but must remain
‘outside’ (Matthew 7:21, 8:10-12, 22:13, 25:30, Revelation
21:27). Those slaves who never knew Jesus as their rescuer will
die a second death. They are not in covenant with God. Their
existence will end in the same process that lucifer and the other
fallen angels (demons) will see their demise (Revelation 20:15).

All of creation is decaying and in need of redemption. Because
of this, God is releasing the understanding and tools to bring
redemption into an unredeemed environment. Those who choose
to lay down their lives will be given these tools, but we must
know that we too are in need of that redemption. We must start
our journey by subjecting ourselves to the same process that we
will apply to the world. We must allow the Light of His presence
to shine in our own lives so our hidden sins are revealed. We
must hurl down the accuser in our own lives. But we also get the
grace and mercy of God to rest in a place of daily freedom that is
easy and good!

KEY

God has a master plan of Love. It is to see as many become the
Lover and Loved of God as possible. To this end, He will send
His adult sons and daughters to the world with a message of
Truth that is void of the pollution of religion. He wants to see
even the least of these rescued. He will give them everything
that they need to freely choose Love. Then it is up to them.

Appendix 

“Look! An army is coming from the north; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth. They are armed with bows and spears; they are cruel and without mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, O Daughter of Babylon.” Jeremiah 50:41–42 

We haven’t been called to train; we are being trained for our call. Just as a dress rehearsal has the same actions as a wedding but isn’t the ceremony, we’re training for the fullness of our mission, which is coming soon! In the adulthood of the Church, we’ve been given the Keys of the Kingdom. We’re learning to drive this “Ferrari” on safe roads to gain the skills we’ll need later. Before long, the roads will be treacherous, and we’ll be grateful beyond words for this time we’ve had to master our skills and gifts with grace. 

The Bridegroom, Jesus, will marry the Holy City of Jerusalem, which is the unified, adult sons and daughters of God. The beast, which the demon of the religion of Christianity, will marry the city of Babylon, which is the unified, adult sons and daughters of satan. The remnant saints are being trained now to go and rescue our lost siblings before they become its citizens, carved with a spiritual cut of covenant on their right palm before getting the beast’s name written on their foreheads.

 “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest field.” Matthew 9:37b–38 
 
 This is an urgent call. The time is short, and the workers are few. We highly encourage you to pray and ask the Lord to send out workers into His harvest field. Ask Him to raise up the cessors assigned to key people in the Church who need to receive the new wineskin. Ask Him if there’s anyone you know who needs to hear the good news. See if He releases you to tell or point them to the many resources available to study and learn. They are all our brothers and sisters. God has given us everything we need to go and get them. Pursue daily bread and yield to His will being done. He will show us what to do and how to get there. His plan is very, very good!

Sample Prayers - Chapter 1: Rest

I have a draft notice in my spiritual mailbox. I freely choose to join this priestly army in accordance with Your will. I cast aside all doubt and do not receive fear from the evil one. I trust You with my life and ask You to teach me to hear Your voice with an ever-growing degree of clarity. 

Father, I ask You to teach me how to minister to Your heart. I ask You to take me to the most intimate places there. Show me the things I was created to know and move in. I ask You to reveal how to petition You and declare on Earth what I see You doing and saying in Heaven.

Father, I ask You to release in me the fullness of my calling to minister to the Temple of the Lord, Your people. I ask You to bring me each person I was created to minister to.

SPIRITUAL SONS AND DAUGHTERS (pg. 61–67) 

*Father, I thank You for the people You have brought into my life as spiritual parents. I thank You for the privilege of learning to truly submit to authority and to place my desires on the altar. I bless those whom You call my spiritual parents and honor them by choosing to lay down my life to receive all You’ve designed me for. I honor them by saying yes to you and then doing what You called me to.* 

*I repent for every time I’ve fallen short of the glory of God. Equally, I forgive my forefathers, those our family has been in covenant with, and those who’ve trespassed against us. I wash our feet with the blood of Jesus, and we are purified, redeemed, and restored. I hurl down the accuser. The memory of these sins is erased, and the rights of the evil one are stripped. I ask You to heal every place in me that has caused fear, anger, or control.*

*I ask You to reveal Your design of how I can receive Love through discipline. I ask You to fully sanctify me through the fire of the Holy Spirit, the Light of Your Presence, the blood of Jesus, and the authority of Christ You’ve delegated to Your adult Church. I ask You to teach me patterns of behavior that align with how Jesus acted on Earth. I ask You to reveal what You were thinking when You created me and assigned me irrevocable gifts and a calling. I ask you to reveal how these will cause me to produce the greatest amount of fruit for the Kingdom. I ask You to lead me, along with my spiritual parents, to the fullness of Christ through my decision to yield to You. I ask You to give me my daily bread of Your will done until I mature to adulthood in the spirit. I give You the glory and honor in all things. Amen.*

MOTHERS AND FATHERS
Now that You have called me to be a spiritual parent to others, I
ask You to reveal to me every place of wounding in my life and
every hard spot in my heart so I can be free of the pain and
dysfunction and become the parent that You want me to be. I
repent for every time I have reacted to life through these soul
wounds and sinned. I also forgive every person who wounded
me, my forefathers, and all those we’ve been in covenant with. I

sprinkle us with the Blood of Jesus that we are purified,
redeemed, and restored. I hurl down the accuser with the Blood
of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. The memory of these
sins is erased from creation.
Father, I ask You to bring to me a womb for my spiritual children
to be safe and Loved while they grow up. I ask You to teach me
how to steward this valuable resource in the Kingdom. I ask You
to teach me Your will for disciplining spiritual children in the
corporate adulthood of the church. I ask You to reveal to me
and through me how discipline is Love. I ask that You sharpen
my discernment and to bring to me all revelation that I will need
to impart to these children. I ask You to bless these children that
they would mature in Your timing, produce great fruit for the
Kingdom, and one-day become parents themselves, blessing me
with spiritual grandchildren. I ask you to show me when and
how to release my children that they could go forth and multiply.
You are our God. You are our King. To You be the glory, and
honor forever. Amen.

Sample Prayer - Chapter 6: Helen Keller 

RELEASING IRREVOCABLE GIFTS (pg. 69–75) 

KEY 1-2: God’s Light & Daily Bread

Father, I ask You to shine the Light of Your Presence to reveal any hidden sins prohibiting me from operating in the fullness of my gifts. I ask You for daily bread of the revelation of Your design for these gifts. I ask for daily bread of the anointing being released for me to use them. I want them today, but I lay my agendas at Your feet. Come Holy Spirit, and lead me to the Father’s will in everything I do! 

KEY 3: The Blood of Jesus Father, I repent of misunderstanding my own gifting and reacting out of my flesh. I repent for hurting my brothers and sisters in the process. I repent of hurting myself. I realize You have a design for these gifts that is better than good; it’s the best! I repent for using these gifts for my will done instead of Yours. I repent of any vows I made never to use my gifts again because they caused me pain. I receive the blood of Jesus. 

KEY 4: The Authority of Jesus Father, I forgive anyone You called who failed to nurture and develop me in my gifts. I forgive those who assessed, judged, and accused me of evil things when I was unknowingly operating in the gifts You gave me. I forgive anyone who used their authority to shut down my gifts. I forgive them all, our forefathers, those we’ve been in covenant with, and any who’ve trespassed against us. I wash us all with Jesus’ blood, and we are now purified, redeemed, and restored back to You. I hurl down the accuser with the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony.

Lord Jesus, I freely choose to believe that You will save me and
enter into servant covenant with You. I receive the Holy Spirit
that I would receive a deeper intimacy in a friendship covenant
so I can be empowered to complete my role in the commission
that You give to Your friends. Heavenly Father, I say “yes” and
accept Your invitation into the Inheritance Covenant. I declare
that I am now more fully your daughter. I receive the fullness of
my inheritance: a new wineskin and a never ending supply of
new wine. I choose to believe that You are fulfilling prophesy
with the generation that I am a part of. I receive the salvation,
power, and authority to rule the Kingdom. I receive the authority
of Christ to be all that You created me to be. I choose to walk in
the identity of king and priest
THE MUSTERING OF THE MEN
For men to pray - ladies use the INTERVENTION prayer for
those men in your lives.
Heavenly Father, I see now that You have been reintroducing
Your ways back to the church. I see that as a part of that, the
church needed to witness Your supernatural power, and also
Your Love. I see now that intimacy with You means spending
time talking to You, telling You what I like and what I don’t, and
hearing what You like and what You don’t. I agree that it was
good for You to release the women of the body of Christ into
their gifting of discernment first. I see now that they will
recognize the Truth from the lies, the Love from the not-Love. I
accept the female in my life for her gifting of discernment and I
choose to trust when she sees a contamination. I trust her ability
to hear Your voice, recognizing that she could make a mistake
and if so, You will save us. I receive my own gifting of revelation
that I might receive the design of Your plans. I receive the
context of Your work so I can ensure that everything that we do
fits within the big picture. I will question the things that don’t
without slowing or shutting down Your move. I celebrate the
destiny You have given us all and how it is beyond good. It is
amazing!

Father I choose this day to give You my life fully. I know that
there is nothing I can do to earn heaven, except believing that
Jesus will save me. I still choose to lay my life down so I can
bear the fruit that You wish to produce through me so my
brothers and sisters who are lost can be found. I choose to stop
defending myself and to start yielding to Your Light so You can
sanctify me of all sin that gives power and authority to the
enemy. I receive my daily bread of Your will done so I can do all
that Jesus did. I choose to Love. I choose to be the child of God
You created me to be who liberates creation from decay so the

SCOTT’S MARINADE MIX. 1 cup red wine, 1/2 cup olive oil,
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup spicy brown mustard, 1/4 cup
yellow mustard, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1/2 tablespoon
rosemary, 1/2 tablespoon thyme, 2 shakes Tabasco styled hot
sauce - whisk mix thoroughly. Excellent for all red meats (steak,
lamb, venison, etc.).
SCOTT’S LEG O’ LAMB. Lamb can be purchased from most
butcher shops or even grocers during the weeks before the
pilgrimage feasts (Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot). For those who
remove the blood, do so by giving the meat a bath in warm water
for about a half hour. Then cover both sides with kosher salt for
30 - 60 minutes. Soak the lamb in warm water for around 10
minutes to get the salt and blood off. Dry the lamb with paper
towels and then lightly cover with salt and black pepper.
Marinade the lamb for 3 - 24 hours with 2/3 of Scott’s Marinade
Mix . Fire grill meat 15 minutes on each side at medium heat
until done. Check frequently to prevent burning. Keep the meat
moist while cooking with the reserve 1/3 marinade.
SHARI’S UNLEAVENED BREAD. 2 cups whole grain flour, 1
cup water, 1 tablespoon olive oil, two shakes cumin. Mix
thoroughly. Make golf ball size pieces, then rolling pin into
football shaped thin strips. Cook in skillet 2 to 3 at a time. Once
skillet fully heats, it should only take a minute or two to cook
each side. Flip each strip and cook the other side. Recipe
makes around 10 - 15 strips. Dip your bread with your favorite
sides: Italian marinara, Mexican guacamole, and / or Arabic
hummus.
BITTER HERBS. Raw horseradish. You might mix some in with
your salad, or with a traditional charoset (apples, nuts,
cinnamon, wine).
CHALLAH BREAD. 2 cups warm water, 2 packages (or tbsp)
dry yeast, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup canola oil, 3 tsp salt, 4 eggs, 8
cups flour, cornmeal and sesame seeds (optional). Place water
and yeast in a large bowl to soften. Add sugar, oil, and salt.
Blend in 3 eggs, plus yolk of 4th. Reserve the white of the 4th for
brushing (refrigerate). Beat in 4 cups of flour until smooth. Let
Terraforming RESToration
302
rest for 5 minutes. Slowly add in the rest of four (remaining 4
cups). Knead bread for 10 minutes on an oiled surface (board).
Return the mix back into the bowl. Cover and allow to rise until
the mix has doubled (approximately 1 and 1/2 hours) in a warm
place. Decide if you want to braid with 3 or 6 ropes. Divide the
dough accordingly and roll: for a 3 braid, roll 9 ropes 14” in
length / 1” in diameter (makes 3 loaves). For a 6 braid, roll 12
ropes 14” in length / 3/4” in diameter (makes 2 loaves). Braid
on a baking sheet covered with cornmeal for a textured bottom
(lay ropes side by side and pinch tops together / braid tightly /
pinch ends and fold under). Brush the loaves with the reserved
egg white. Sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired. Let rise in a
warm place for 30 minutes to one hour. Bake at 350° for 30-45
minutes until done. Only two loaves are served for Shabbat
(Sabbath).

righteousness and an entire nation of people became Your own.
We thank You Father that equally, when we believed in our

You created us to be. As adult sons and daughters of God, we

Father, we choose to rehearse this exodus of Your people from

world that is coming will not harm us or our children. The
memory of our sins is erased from creation and we are all set
free. We ask You Lord to reveal the Truth to the world, even
through Justice, which is the mercy that comes before judgment.
We ask You to fulfill Your covenants with us that we may become
all that we were created to be, and as Jesus before us, that we

Father, I freely choose to believe and confess with my mouth that
Jesus Christ will save me by covenant from the second death. I
will obey your commands. I also choose to spend more time with
You each day as You teach me to be close to You. I will accept
Your invitations to intimacy that I would no longer be called
Your servant, but rather, Your friend.
I also freely choose to give to lay down all of my life so I may
become a part of Your family. I want to have an inheritance in
the Kingdom of God. And so I relinquish my own property and
plans to receive the one You have for me.
From this day forward I choose to yield to daily bread portions
of Your will done so I can mature into adulthood. I want to be a
part of that group of saints that will reap the greatest harvest in
history. I want to be a blessing on the earth that helps to
increase the number of those harvested! I trust that You will get
me there in accordance with Your will. Amen.

Sample Prayer: THE UNFORGIVABLE SIN
Our Father, we repent of every covenant that we have entered
into with the beast that is the demonic spirit with authority over
religion. We repent of every thought, choice, or action that was
self motivated, conditional, temporary, or untruthful. We repent
of blessing any personalities within us that are formed upon
wounds in our heart that have not yet been redeemed. We repent
of allowing these to rule our being for our will done instead of
Yours.
We receive the Blood of Jesus that we are now purified,
redeemed, and restored back to You. We hurl down the accuser
with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. The
memory of these sins is erased from creation. We choose to be
faithful from this day forward. As the bride of Jesus, we pray in
His name. Amen.
Sample Prayer: from 144,000
TRAITS
Father, we freely choose to follow the Lamb where ever He goes.
We listen to the discernment that You are giving to us and go
where You go, when You go there. We follow Jesus by believing
and trusting our Father. We pursue sanctification so we can see
our God face-to-face. We give up our lives so we can have Your
name and live in Your house Lord. We take up our cross and
deny ourselves daily by pursuing our daily bread of Your will
done. We humbly repent for every time we’ve fallen short of
Your glory Lord. Equally, we forgive all those who’ve trespassed
against us. We wash us all with the Blood of Jesus, and we are
all purified, redeemed, and restored back to You. The memory of
our sins is erased. We thank You for intervening in our lives and
purchasing us so we could be first fruits of the Kingdom. We
accept this calling and choose to cut a path for others to follow.
We choose to rescue our siblings. Amen.
THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST
Father we declare that we will have no other gods before You.
Our relationship and covenants are directly with You, and not
through any church institution or denomination. We freely
Terraforming RESToration
316
choose to believe in You to enter the covenant of salvation. We
receive the Blood of Jesus so we can be purified to enter Your
presence as friends. We want to spend time with You. We lay
down our lives to obtain the life You have for us. We choose to
die daily that You can bring us daily portions of Your will for our
lives. We willingly give up selfishness that decays unto death in
exchange for the selflessness of Your Love that is eternal. We do
not accept the cut of covenant with the beast of religion on the
palms of our hands. We do not allow the name of the beast to be
written on our foreheads. We enter covenant with You through
Jesus Christ and receive Your cut of covenant on our hands, and
Your name on our foreheads. We belong to You. Praise Your
holy name!!! Amen.
SPEAK NOW
Father we Love our brothers and sisters in the church. We
recognize that many of them are in covenant with themselves
through the freewill choices of their soul wounds. Many are in
covenant with a demon of religion that is fighting to promote the
agenda of the kingdom of not-Love. We know that these brothers
and sisters want to be in covenant with You Lord, but their
understanding of You comes from other wounded people whose
beliefs are tainted by deception. We ask You to shine Your Light
and show us Your plan for rescuing these people. We yield to
Your will in all that we do. We know that when You release us,
we can dismantle deceptions and ask You for intervention. Until
that time, we wait on You and rest knowing that You have a
master plan of Love. Amen.

Sample Prayers: FOES
DISMANTLING THE EXCHANGE
Father I ask You to shine Your Light and reveal any and every
time that I came into agreement with the evil one to receive
anything in exchange for my sins. I receive the Blood of Jesus
that I am now purified, redeemed, and restored back to You. I
hurl down the accuser and the power of this agreement and all
curses are undone. The sins are washed away. The covenants
and declarations of evil are dissolved. Amen.
DISMANTLING THE ENEMY’S BACKUP PLAN
Father I ask You to shine Your Light and reveal any person
whose agreement with the enemy could impact Your will being
done in my life. I forgive them with the Blood of Jesus that they
are now purified, redeemed, and restored back to You. I hurl
down the accuser that the deception of the enemy is dismantled.
I ask You Father to intervene in their lives with Truth. Lord,
please show them who You are that they might be rescued from
the lies of the evil one. Amen.
Sample Prayer: from CASTING THE NET
FREEDOM
God, I freely choose to believe that Jesus died so I can be in
covenant with you. I believe that Jesus was resurrected back to
life as a demonstration that Love was not defeated, but was
victorious. Even if my body dies one-day, my spirit will live
forever. I decide now to believe this and stay in covenant with
You for the rest of my life and for eternity.
FRIENDS
God, I want to learn what it means to see you face-to-face. I
know that it starts with having clean hands and a pure heart. I
believe that Jesus was whipped and beaten so I could be made
pure by the Blood that came from His wounds. I choose to
receive the free gift of the Blood of Jesus. In Your eyes God, I
am now purified, redeemed, and restored back to You. I can
come to You and have a deeper relationship than that of servant.
I can become Your friend and You will share with me Your
desires, likes, and dislikes as I share mine. When You invite me

over to Your house, I choose to accept the invitation! I want to
know You more! Amen.
CHILDREN
God, I want to become Your child. As a friend I have my own
house and my own name. I freely choose to give these
possessions away so I can live in Your house and have Your
name. I ask You to give me today my portion of Your will done in
my life. I choose to pursue this portion every day and to yield to
Your will done. When You call me, I will come to the table and
eat with You. You are now my Father. Amen.
ADULT BRIDE
Father, I want to mature and become an adult child of God. For
this I freely choose to give up the part of me that is selfish and of
the kingdom of ‘not-Love.’ I choose to let that part of me die
each day so I can become the adult that You created me to
become. I ask You to shine Your Light in my life and reveal both
the hidden choices that I’ve made of ‘not-Love,’ and the hidden
treasures that You have set-aside for me as an inheritance. I
accept Jesus’ commission of being sent to the world to live as
You sent Jesus. I ask You to fill me with the Holy Spirit of Christ
so I will have the power to fulfill this commission. I receive the
calling of a royal priest who ministers to Your heart, and to the
people of the world. I accept the destiny You have given us of
liberating creation from the bondage of decay. As You bring to
us revelation of the hidden sins that gave the evil one power and
authority to bring decay to creation, we will forgive those sinners
with the Blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.
Through this mighty commission of Jesus, we will rescue and
feed many of His lost sheep. Amen.
